25-34,null,Busy but a good quality hotel. Would stay again.
18-24,MALE,Great Old Dame I have been in Madrid several times before I have stayed in many hotels there but none compare to the Palace It is ideally located next to Madrids main museums. Its service couldnt be better the concierge can get you a reservation wherever you want everyone is willing to help to make your stay the best possible. I also recommend a lot the hotels breakfast it is simply amazing
35-49,MALE,Great time in the Dominican I went with my now fiance I proposed there and found the Bavaro to be beautiful. The grounds were well cared for and the lobby gorgeous. My travel agent booked through Apple and there was an Apple rep in the larger lobby area. This was both convient and comforting. The beach was the most beautiful Ive seen. Plenty of room and seats to sunbathe. Our room was spacious and clean. A wet bar in the room was just right for evening cocktails on the porch of our room. The staff were friendly and courteous. We did however have problems with water pressure in our room. Though the food selection had a wide variety it was only fair tasting and left us with minor stomache trouble. The entertainment had an impressively wide range but could be amateurish at times. All tried hard though wich made it for the most part fun. The beach and pool area had a burger and hot dog stand. It was so bad it had an almost comic value AVOID While we were there a fire burnt down a large building near the pool and beach closing at least 3 restaurants. Even so there were still plenty of places to eat and drink and the staff worked very hard to clean up and make up for the loss. The grounds are HUGE and though they have regular shuttle service to and from the rooms and lobby be ready for long walks. Not the fanciest place in the world but was appropiately priced and I had a great time.
35-49,FEMALE,Great Staff in New Orleans The French Quarter Courtyard is a good place to stay if you want to visit the French Quarter and are on a budget. The best thing about the hotel is the staff. Miss Wendy will accomodate your requests without hesitation. Also the valets will get your car at any time without delay. The rooms are clean but could use some updating of the furniture and bathrooms. If you have loud neighbors that come in late you will definitely hear them. I was traveling on business by myself and really did not think the neighborhood was too safe at night to be out alone. But if you have some other people with you I dont think that you would have any problems with the location of the hotel. This hotel is for someone that wants to experience a quaint hotel and is not expecting the Four Seasons.
50-64,MALE,Decent enough hotel I have mixed feelings about my stay at this hotel. The staff were excellent and very helpful. When I had problems with their WiFi it didnt work or when I accidentally broke one of the shade cords in my room they were very prompt in 5 minutes in fixing the problem. They were also great for the diving I did with Caribe Aquatic Adventures.On the down side I thought their continental breakfast was sorrowful. Theyre also 2 miles from Old San Juan. It cost me $10 each way to go to and from there via a taxi.If you intend to see Old San Juan Id try to find a hotel that is closer. If you want one that is close to a beach this might be the one for you. If you want one close to the cruise ship piers you might want to find one closer to the piers. Itll cost you $13.50 via taxi to get to the Pan American pier from this hotel and $10 to get to pier 4 which I believe is used for transiting cruise ships.
null,MALE,Convenient When I say Above Average Im comparing to sparse alternative offerings in the Ponce area and being an avid golfer this place having no competition in the south central portion to the island. The resort was easy to get to and conveniently located but it in the greater worldwide scheme of things wasnt anything close to special. Furthermore aside from the outstanding 27 hole on site golf course it was not redeeming other than it was situated on the ocean to be more precise the Carribean Sea and had two separate pool and beach areas one moderate size family pool with large beach area at hotel and another dazzling adult pool with small beach area at the golf course clubhouse complex. We ate out in town but availed ourselves to the bar lounge area good but expensive mixed drinks and beer and to the casino okay but not exciting and no Vegas - or Mesquite for that matter. The rooms were clean and all have a view toward the ocean overlooking the gardened grounds but it was not spacious or memorable. At this low season stay we still had to pay a AAA rate of $160 and pony up an extra $8 parking fee for the priviledge of parking in one of several hundred unsused spaces in a cavernous parking lot as well as a $11+ resort fee were told to pay for groundskeeping costs. All in all this single night stay and playing the full 27 holes of golf was fine and dandy but it doesnt beckon to me to pay a return visit.
35-49,MALE,Good stay geat way to have a bfast
25-34,MALE,Huge room great location What a surprise upon arrival.......when I entered the small lobby I thought this was going to be one of those boutique hotels that only looked nice on websites...but it wasnt like that when we got into our huge room. Theres a living area separate from the big comfortable bed and also a separate office area....the bathroom was huge ase well. The room was extremely comfortable and the decorations are very classy. The location is right by the Sony Center but a bit far from the main shopping area. I would stay at this hotel again when I visit Berlin...the size of the rooms cant be beat in Europe.
35-49,MALE,Thin walls Good value rooms Pleasantly surprised by room sizenot huge but adequate.Comfybeds and clean bathroom.What annoyed us was the noise levels from either side until the early hoursalmost like they were in the room with you In a good location for seeing the sights.The hotel staff could do with brushing up on the surrounding areaas i asked directions to a well known restaraunt and believe it or not the main bus station and they couldnt tell me where either were.
35-49,MALE,Great location hit-or-miss service View from foyer to the room bathroom on the right.
50-64,FEMALE,Good hotel Nice Staff This hotel is on the second floor of a multi-storied building. A business is on the first floor. It is decorated nicely and our room was a good size as was the bathroom. The breakfast was bread pastries cereals etc. and very good cappuccinos. It is a short walk to the Accademia and the rest of the tourist attractions are a walkable distance but we were told the buses went by frequently if you want to walk. There seem to be any restaurants etc. in the immediate area around the hotel which may bother some people. The big plus for this hotel was its pleasant and informative staff. Each one was very courteous and helpful. The desk clerk and the two of us were the only ones up at 5:30AM when she called a cab for us. The cab came in 5 minutes. Now service
25-34,MALE,Very comfortable; central location This is a very nice hotel that American travelers will identify with - by that I mean it was air conditioned and nicely appointed. Modestly sized for European hotels it was very comfortable for one or two people. The room was very clean.The decor is modern. Interestingly the shower area had a glass wall that was shared with the sleeping area. Modesty is preserved through strategically placed glass frosting but if youre traveling with a non-intimate friend you might be a bit uncomfortable. Also the bathroom had a bottle opener on the wall which I thought very considerate it probably avoids damage to the surfaces - who among us have not found novel ways of opening bottles?.The room included an in-room safe that fit a 15 laptop much appreciated and a mini-bar which I didnt use. A flat panel TV with several English channels was included. Free internet was provided which is unique in European hotels.The location is very convenient between the Amsterdam Centraal Station and the big museums Van Gogh and the Rijksmuseum. Its about a 20 minute walk or so from the station but there is a tram station about 50 yards from the hotel on Rembrandt Square. Tram line 4 and 9 go between the rail station and Rembrandt Square. The hotel is just off the square. It doesnt look like much from the street but appearances are deceiving. There is a restaurant attached which I didnt use.All in all a very nice hotel that American travelers will find familiar and very comfortable. On a personal note they allowed me to check in at 10am which I very much appreciated. This was not arranged ahead of time.
50-64,MALE,clean and comfortable we thought this hotel was very good close to all amenities though it is in a little seedy area we had no problem at all the pool is small but the sunbeds and chairs on the decking are very comfortable and a good view breakfast is continental style  everything there you would want it could pay you to bring your own teabags though never had evening meal there is a little road noise but if you are higher than 2 floor or at the rear it is no problem especially after a couple of drinks on the ramblas will go back again
25-34,MALE,Very modern Prince Kuhio - Ocean View
65-XX,MALE,Great holiday My wife and I have travelled all over the world. We staid at the Catalonia from Dec. 1 to Dec. 15 2007. After reading earlier reviews on this site I was somewhat wary of what we were going to find once there. What a surprise We had 2 outstanding weeks. We had heard that mosquitoes were aboundant. We saw none. Food was supposed to be very poor. In fact it was quite good. We had breakfast at the beachside buffet dining room lunch at the poolside grill and pizza bar which serves grilled chicken burgers dogs as well thin crusty pizza cooked in a wood-burning oven. What a snack Dinner was always in the main dining room. The buffet was varied and you had many options even if you were not into fish or seafood. Our studio was at ground level and looked out onto the golf course. The king-size bed was excellent. Coffee and perculator were provided so we could have coffee in the room at any time. A bonus was the oversize sooker tub with plenty of hot water at any time of day as well as a convenient shower. The studio was kept immaculately cleen. 1$US per day left on the pillow works wonders. Try it...My wife loved walking the many paths in the parklike central area of the property. We are in our early sixties yet we were surprised to find so many families with young children and an astounding number of young babies. It is a very good sign when you spend 2 weeks in a semi-tropical location like Punta Cana and never hear of anyone becoming sick or indisposed. I think it is to the credit of this hotel that they consider good hygienic practices in order to assure the coninued comfort of their guests. The management goes to great lengths to provide a good beach but it is always at the mercy of prevailing winds which bring weeds after breaking over the outer coral reef.The animation team is always busy trying to keep people busy and happy. Evening entertainment is typical of al the other hotels imilar in size in the D.R. If you are looking for for an enjoyable uncomplicated relaxing holiday this is a good place. I definitely recommend it for families with young children 6 mos. to 10 years old couples who just want to relax as well as older travellers. The hotel isalso well suited to people who might have some difficulty walking about - the only requisit is to reserve a ground-level studio.Happy
65-XX,MALE,Fabulous Hotel with very friendly staff From the warm welcome to the sad goodbye  our stay at the hotel was great in every aspect .Breakfast has to be experienced to be appreciated although dinners could be expensive . However  as usual  you get what you pay for .All the hotel staff from the General Manager  yes he is easily available  downward are extremely friendly  welcoming and eager to please .There are hawkers on the beach but they also have the Balinese gift of a warm smile and friendly disposition .The guests are cosmopolitan with no rowdiness and a genteel air of luxury and laziness prevails .The hotel  in summary  satisfied all of our holiday wishes .
25-34,MALE,great hotel great value great location ... to bad for the A/C My wife and I stayed ther this past October. Its a marvelous hotel quite chic and nice cozy rooms. The buffet breakfast is outstanding and not only for european standards.The location though a 5min walk to the nearest metro station Anton Martin its very convenient. Right infront of Plaza de Santa Ana and a 10min walk to Sol Gran Via Atocha Station etc....The only incovenience we found was that the AC system wasnt working due to the fact that its centralized and switched to heat for the cold season. But it was raining outside so having the windows opened was not an option nor turning on the AC or heat. So we had to manage ourselves to cool down a bit. That aside I would definetely recommend the hotel and for sure make sure the next time either the AC works properly or rain/snow is not forecasted 
35-49,MALE,Over Priced Over Designed Disapointment What a disapointment this hotel isThere is so much more to a trendy boutique hotel than just a beautiful building and unfortunately this is the only thing going for the Dylan. Hotel staff were very dismissive to the point of ignoring you when you are actually standing in the reception room. We had early check-in booked as we were on an early flight however the room was not ready until almost 3pm none of the staff offered an explaination or apologised for the inconvenience. Check-in to the room only to have house keeping come in about 10min after arrival to re-stock the mini bar explaining they had not had time to do it yet but would do it now so we would not be charged for missing items. Unbelievable.The rooms whilst supposedly designer chic are ridiculously over designed. We had the kimono/japanese inspired room which required you to bend over to see into the bathroom mirror sit on your knees to have a shave or use the small shaving mirror which was located on the adjacent wall but the lighting cast a massive shadow which made this useless. The shower dribbled against the wall so we got the maintenance person to put a new one in only to find it was equally useless. The rooms have a table and chair at the end of the bed or a couch located directly under the plasma tv on the wall again useless. Not really designer chicWe expressed our concerns to the hotel manager who advised we could not be moved on out first night but he could change our room on the second. Not wanting the hassle we opted to stay in the existing room and having spoken to other guests it sounds as though the other rooms are equally overdesigned although we did not see them first hand.A really disapointing overpriced hotel. Definately not worth the money. Would not stay here again.
25-34,FEMALE,loved it My mother and I stayed here for a long weekend and we both loved the hotel. The location is very central close to oxford street and mable arch - still our room was soo quiet Stayed in a standard room - a little small as we imagined - but very clean and stylish. The staff is very nice polite and helpfull made our experience even greater. Overall - loved it
18-24,FEMALE,Great Location Fron of hotel
65-XX,FEMALE,Small quiet and friendly Stayed here for 4 nights late September and were given a larger room with juliette balcony - rooms not large by American standards but good for Paris they also have suites suitable if you have a family. Comfortable beds and air conditioning and unusually for European hotels a kettle with tea bags in the room and an iron and ironing board. I wish all hotels would do this. Excellent friendly welcome good English spoken breakfast with cereals boiled eggs pastries and good coffee and juice in small dining room. We particularly liked the quiet street without the traffice noise normally found in Paris.Small food shops just round the corner and not far to restaurants or metro but be prepared to do a lot of walking taxis are not that easy to get take comfortable footwear
65-XX,FEMALE,Lovely Hotel Lovely grounds and pool areas. Beach rooms are dark and gloomy linen/towels could do with replacing. Bathrooms in need of refurb but would still recomment this hotel and stay here again. Staff very friendly. Pool bar very popular especially at happy hour. Personally dont like Indonesian food but cakes fabulous and breakfast okay. Top tip get up early to get a sun lounger seems that pool man may be earning a few rupiah by reserving for some guests - you know who you are. Evening dance entertainment excellent.Very friendly place clean well kept and beautiful gardens which are sprayed each evrening to keep insects at bay beach lovely -slopes a bit into sea but quite fun getting in and out.Best in Sanur and good value.
65-XX,MALE,OK for the Price but Look Elsewhere The hotel was OK a little run down with average cleanliness but we chose it for price as Seattle is quite expensive. We didnt get the room/bed that we reserved and the staff was unhelpful. Best Westerns used to always have nice hotels but this one doesnt fit that mold. Well choose a different hotel probably more expensive the next time we visit Seattle.
50-64,MALE,Central location My wife and I stayed at The Handlery for two nights on route to Hawaii. The hotels location was very convenient for sight seeing around San Francisco close to numerous places to eat and drink a cable car ride and many major department stores were all within walking distance. The purpose of our holiday was to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary and on arrival we were greeted by John Handlery Vice Pres and a bottle of champagne and a basket of friut etc were bought to our room. We found the overall experience very enjoyable and would recommend this hotel to others.One small complaint. Our room had no wardrobe space although this may had been different had we been staying longer.
25-34,MALE,fun place for honeymoon we went to honolulu as a side trip from our main honeymoon in kauai. overall i would say that i prefer kauai 10 to 1 over honolulu but that is not the point of this post after all. first off the outrigger is in GREAT location. it really cant be beat. the property has a number of GREAT restaurants esp Dukes. we were there on a sunday and some locally famous musician was playing outside at Dukes--it was a real party and packed with locals. that being said this hotel may be best for the younger crowd who likes loud music and partying. the view from our room was spectacular. we book oceanfront and starred off miles into the pacific every morning. no sunset views from anywhere in the building though--the sheraton is in the way. The pool area was fun and poolside service is good. food not too expensive and drinks are standard. a tip for those like me who want to save money on alcohol--go across teh street and buy your stuff from ABC and bring along a soft sided cooler from home and tote it with you to the pool. no one will stop you. The only problem with this places as I see it is the cost. we paid 350 for our room and yes had a great view but it just felt lacking for that price. The inside seems a little bit old and out of date. The service was nice but I did NOT like the check in process. The guy sat us down and offered us a drink and everything is going fine. Then the guy starts talking real loud about how much the room will cost and all of that. My wife almost lost it when she found out how much it was. Whether you prices are high or low please use some discretion I know how much it costs--I booked the darn thingdefinitely see pearl harbor. we rented a car for 2 days from budget at the airport and only paid 50 bucks TOTAL. just avoid buying any of their insurance. We paid as much in parking 25/day as we did for the car.overall if i go back to waikiki unlikely I would stay here again. Maybe I would just go for the cheapest room I could get and not worry about it b/c apart from the view theyre all the same and not really that nice. spend most of your time at their pool beach and restaurants which are all genuinely fun.
18-24,FEMALE,Not 5 Star I recently got back from this hotel on the 21st December 2007 after a weeks stay in what i thought would be a 5 star hotel. Dont get me wrong it was well worth what we paid. However WARNING I advise that if you are travelling from the UK you DO NOT upgrade your room through your travel agent. Wait until you get there. I had set my heart on a room with a jacuzi and was utterly disappointed. We booked through the agent and paid an extra 300 dollars only to find that when we got there we had been upgraded to the Deluxe Suite which was in building 2 not 7. After enquiring at reception we could have paid that amount at the reception for the room we wanted however although we had already paid one this was a standard upgrade charge so then would have to pay again AS IF IM MADE OF MONEY anyway after that we got into a room in building 2. It was adequate the air con was an absolute god send. The alcohol was absolutely disgusting i hardly drank anything all week. The food i would say was ok. Breakfast had a very good choice and was to a good standard and the evening meals were ok didnt get ill thank god As for the beach it was lovely. However be careful as you will continually be hassled everywhere on this resort by shop owners time share guys watersports guys etc They drove me in sane Also watch out for the local market people that appear at the resort twice a week just dont even look i spent half an hour getting very stressed trying to tell them that i WAS NOT going to pay 150 dollars for a stone necklace They think your stupid All in all i had a wonderful time here due to the fact that we booked on lots of excursions. Therefore not spending much time on the resort. Definately do the Outback Safari its a fantastic day out. Just hope you dont go on a day when there is a tropical storm like we did.  If you go with an open mind you will love it here just expect the rooms to be anything like the pictures. The food also looks like its from a glossy magazine How WRONG Take money with you and do the trips And last but most importantly if any one approaches you JUST SAY NO
65-XX,FEMALE,A very nice place to stay View of the courtyard
65-XX,MALE,Very Nice Stay We stayed at the Park Hotel Shiodome October 27-30 2006. We generally agree with the positive reviews. High quality room not large but this is Japan and we had great city views of the Tokyo Tower and surroundings from the 28th floor. Found a very high level of service from greeting us at ground level and taking us to check in on the 25th floor. Staff at desk had fluent English. The room has nice amenities and as said by others nice to get an English newspaper International Herald Tribune combined with English version of Asahi Shimbun. We booked over the internet for 17500 yen per night not particularly cheap but not bad for Tokyo.It is a bit confusing to find especially at ground level because of construction right now and it is across from the somewhat similarly named Royal Park Hotel. Like others we had some trouble navigating at first until we found that if you exit at the 3rd floor you can exit turning left to reach an upper level walkway that takes you past the Royal Park on your right then you turn left to reach Shimbashi station which has the Yamanote rail and Ginza subway lines. If you take the escalator down near the Royal Park there are restaurants and shopping. Also on the 3rd level if you go right past the new yurakicho sky train station you reach the Pedi Shiodome which has some very nice restaurants and coffee shops which we frequented. We also ate in the underground by Shimbashi station. We did not eat in the hotel though on the ground level there is nice cafe Cafe Des Artes.We have stayed at Keio Plaza in Shinjuku previously and the ANA in Roppongi. While the ANA is a superior hotel we found the Park to be good value for the money. Unlike another reviewer we did mind being a little out of the action and having a bit of a quiet retreat in a smaller more boutique like hotel. We would happily stay there again.
18-24,FEMALE,Highly recommend this outstanding resort Majestic was everything we dreamed of and more for our wedding. We flew down with avid travellers who were blown away with this resort do not have any doubts. stay here you will not regret it it brings tears to my eyes thinking of the memories I will forever hold in my heart.If you have any questions feel free to ask I chose not to write a lengthly review as there is just too much to say.
65-XX,MALE,Very Comfortable Holiday at the L T I Left nov 29 to dec 13This was our first experience with LTI and we really enjoyed it. The rooms are kept very clean and the service is top notch. What I personally like about this resort is that it is not so huge as to be intimidating. You get to know the staff  who are very friendly and accomodating in every way. I really felt relaxed and quite at ease. There were ampel chairs around the pool as well as at the beach. Towels were plentifull. The food was very good and the variety was exceptional.
50-64,FEMALE,Absolutely divine We stayed 4nights at the Ca dei Dogi apartment which is immediately oppsite the main boutique hotel. Stefano and Suzanna are the most delightful helpful hosts/owners. We arrived in the pouring rain and were immediately taken to our 6th floor apartment to enable us to dry out and relax. Stefano threw open the shutters to our terrace to reveal a view to the palace and campanile. The terrace is framed by pots and pots of miniature roses. Our apartment was spacious with fully equipped kitchen living room seperate bedroom and bathroom and was immaculately clean. The location - superb The Bridge of Sighs is 10 metres away and St Marco square is a 2 minute walk - get up at dawn and stroll to the square to see it empty of crowds - breathtaking
25-34,FEMALE,Great rooftop hangout Rooftop of Il Bargellino
65-XX,FEMALE,Great Value for the Money Just returned from our 2nd visit to Waikiki West enjoyed this trip as much as last year. Since we both smoke we were given an unrenovated room with kitchenette on the 1st floor by the pool which was great as I use a wheelchair didnt have to always wait for a mostly empty elevator. Speaking of the elevators we had a good time going to different floors as many people didnt know how to use their room card correctly to hit the right floor. We heard very little grumbling about the mixups mostly people treated it as an adventure. The staff was great - everything we asked for we received in record time. We tipped housekeeping every day a thank you note was left for us. Our room was large enough to accommodate the wheelchair; it was very clean - no bugs; any dishes left in the sink were washed for us; bell staff were more than kind helpful. As others have stated the WW is right on the bus line a short walk to the beach right across from The Pantry which has everything anyone could need for their stay. A word of warning if you eat at Chilis dress warmly as the temperature is somewhere around freezing but the food is worth it. Cant wait to return next year Aloha
25-34,FEMALE,Amazing hotel; couldnt have asked for more View from 17th flr balcony
25-34,MALE,Wonderful vacation South Pacific Hotel
65-XX,MALE,Very nice weekend downtown hotel This is probably the 4th or 5th time we have stayed at the downtown Omni Hotel on South Olive in Los Angeles. We stay there after driving over from Phoenix to attend the LA Opera and can easily walk to Dorothy Chandler Music Center. Also the weekend rates are reasonable about $109.00 before taxes via a website registration. However there a a $24.00 per night parking charge for guestsThe rooms we have had were all large and very pleasant often with good views. The bathrooms have separate tubs and showers and excellent toiletries. The closets are spacious and have plenty of hangers. In short this is a true 4 star hotel and our only problem was that we requested a king size bed and received two queens on this stay.The lobby entrance is off Olive street on the first floor. The two restaurants one the high end dinner spot Noe and the other a full service cafe are on the third floor which leads out to Grand Avenue directly adjacent to the Museum of Contemporary Art. This occurs because the hotel is on top of Bunker Hill so Olive Street is below Grand Avenue at this point.There are a number of downtown restaurants but usually they are not busy on weekend nights. We often have breakfast at a deligtfully funky and very inexpensive spot about a mile and a half away on Figueroa and 9th Street.The hotel is fairly quiet on weekends except for the occasional wedding or high school prom; but I imagine would be a lot more active during the week since it is in the heart of the Los Angeles high rise business district.We recommend this hotel.
25-34,FEMALE,Fabulous Time I just returned home from a week vacation at Iberostar. I went from the 25th of Nov to the 2nd of December with my family and best friend.The hotel was beautiful. The landscaping was jsut wonderful..the gardens were maintained very well and they were very colourful. The beach was also very nice and aswell was the pool. It was kind of hard to find a good chair on the beach you had to look kind of hard. There was a great variety of bars all across the resort my favorite had to ahve been the lobby bar. The Bartenders were very nice and helpful when choosing a good drink. A really good drink id recommend to try would be an Iberostar or an Alexandre..tey were so tastyThe entertainment was prety good and the night show was generally very well done. The animacion staff were very friendly and tried to get everyone involved. They ahd a beach party the one night and it was quite a fun time. The disco was really neat and they played a large variety of good music.We went on 2 of the excursions..We went snorkeling with the sharks and sting rays and also to Saona Island. Saona island wasnt really something that I would recommend.The service at the hotel was awesome they seemed to be able to tend to everything you needed..The one tihng I jsut wasnt to happy with was the food..Al though alot of people seemed to enjoy it I wasnt a big fan.But I would recommend getting a reservation at the stake house beucase the food was really good there. it was probably the best all week.Overall this resort was fantastic I have been to the Dominican twice and now and would definatly love to go back. I would recommend this to many people and definatly people looking for alot of fun. I hope this is helpful
35-49,FEMALE,Very nice but.... my grandson in the pool
25-34,MALE,5 Star Grounds but 4 Star Service To set the table properly my wife and I decided on this resort after a few early reviews regarding the place. We travel a couple of times a year and enjoy in order: Grounds Beaches Pools Service Food and Entertainment. We average 29 years of age and have been to Bahamas Jamaica Cancun Playa Del Carmen and many other places. I would rate this place a 5 star on its grounds as it exceeds to some of the nicest and well rated hotels and resorts we have been to. However the service is inconsistent so although I want to drop it to a 4 star I imagine a better resort in the Resort is Grand to say the least it is absolutely gorgeous very modern and just perfect. The restaurants are all very upscale with a focus on presentation. The room we stayed Royal Service with a King bed and Sofa is very inviting and upscale. The beach is beautiful with the sand being perfect but the sea weed overbearing at times.The problems we encountered were directly related to Royal Service. To begin we arrived late afternoon and were not on the Royal Service list so we had to wait about 45 minutes for a room not a big deal. I tried to contact the resort to confirm reservations 2 times and I never received a response. Since we paid for Royal Service I expected a butler available for reasonable request. Three out of the six nights we tried to order wine or champagne and it never came even after multiple calls. This was disappointing finally began to make requests for a bottle of wine at 5pm and still would not receive our request by 7pm each time if we ever received it. Even with this being stated I recommend Royal Service just for the cabanas at the beach and pool in addition to restaurant and areas that you have privileged to. As we noticed that by 8am the cabanas were already taken by the non-Royal Service pool.I hope I am not overstating the disappointment with Royal Service as some staff were eager to please and did whatever they could to make your moment enjoyable. This is separate than order made for food was delivered promptly regardless of the time of day.In response to those that wander if the hotel will be able to function at full capacity well here is the review: the resort was booked for 3 of the 7 days we stayed and we never had to make reservations at any restaurant. We were sat immediately at our arrival and neither the restaurants nor the pool/beach area were crowded. All in all this is a magnificent place with 5 Star Grounds if/when they truly get the service together it will be amazing destination for anyone lucky enough to go.
50-64,FEMALE,No longer a 5 star hotel We had stayed here a few years ago and really thought it was a beautiful hotel. So based on our previous experience we decided we would stop over for two nights at the hotel before making our way to Cape Cod. The hotel is in a good location but looks as if management is cutting corners. The hotel gets a great deal of traffic and it shows. The room used for the breakfast buffet and evening cocktails is a bit shabby overcrowded and not that clean. Worst of all and to our dismay the hotel is pet friendly. Pets can be quite wonderful we have our own but please leave them at home We booked two rooms for two nights over $1000 per night. One room smelled like a cat had been in it and neglected to use the cat box The other room had pet hair on the bed and all over the carpet I do give the hotel credit for being responsive. We were given a small suite to replace the horrible smelling first room and the room with pet hair was eventually better cleaned and clothes that had picked up pet hair were laundered by the hotel at no charge to us. But it took a day and half before anyone at the hotel even admitted that it was pet friendly We just kept thinking how strange it was that someone had an animal in their room Really is that what anyone expects from a so called five-star hotel? We spent so much time when we first checked in dealing with problems that the entire stay was really ruined. Again when we complained the staff was helpful but not what I would call overly apologetic for such unacceptable conditions.This hotel clearly is banking on the fact that its location on the harbor is enough to compensate for its shortcomings. And if you stay here I recommend you ask for a room that hasnt accomodated animals
25-34,FEMALE,Great hotel My husband and I stayed at the Duquesne for 3 days in early October and we had a wonderful time. We opened the door to our corner room on the 1st floor and the room was spotless with a clear view of the Eiffel Tower. We arrived after midnight and the guy at the front desk was very welcoming. His English was ok but he had said that breakfast was included in our price. Apparently it wasnt since at check out we noticed breakfast was tacked on to our final amount. And at quite a hefty price too. That was the only issue though. Not sure on the size of the other rooms but the corner rooms are generously sized ask for a room that ends with a 5 which are the corner rooms. The shower/sink is separate from the toilet but both were very clean. The Metro is just 2 blocks away Ecole Militaire stop and there are a couple cafes along the street. There is quite a bit of street/traffic noise during the day but the windows actually do a great job in minimizing it. We had a hard time finding the street upon arrival so make sure you have good directions perhaps from the hotel. Overall had an excellent stay at the Duquesne.
50-64,FEMALE,great hotel in a great city After choosing this hotel from reviews on TripAdvisor we were not disappointed. It was comfortable beautiful and in a quiet neighborhood which was refreshing after the crowds of Barcelona. We took the Bus Touristic which was about a 10 minute walk away but the subway is about a block away and easy to use. The only thing that we were disappointed in were the lack of decent restaurants that were handy. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.
35-49,MALE,This is my favourite hotel Shibuya Tokyu Excel is my favourite hotel in the world. My company complained that at $300+ SGD per night its a bit expensive but it is TokyoI love the location of this hotel. Its in the trendiest part of Tokyo sitting right on top of the worlds busiest pedestrian crossing and more importantly near a pivotal railway station.The hotel room is quite small maybe not by Tokyo standards but it is very very comfortable with a nice bath and a techno toilet. The selection of beverages in the minibar is very wide - one night I had no idea what I was drinking.The best part is the Japanese breakfast. I have never had another breakfast like it and it has modified my food habits. As a bonus its served at the top of the hotel so theres an excellent view to be had of Tokyo central.I am looking forward to my next trip to Tokyo and I will definitely be staying here.
18-24,MALE,Perfect escape The hotel and service was perfect and worth far more than 3 stars. Check in was smooth and the staff were very friendly throughout our whole stay. The room was always spotless and had plenty of space. Each day your room also gets free bottled water so you can avoid the bali belly. The resort is aimed at those wanting a romantic peaceful getaway. Not many children around which we personally saw as a major plus. The building itself looks very nice and has some grand stonework which looks even better in the night-light. There is a nice selection of shops and food onsite the breakfast included in your stay has a great choice and a lot of foods are cooked to order infront of you omelettes etc. They also offer room service until the early hours however if you wanted to try a wider selection of local cuisine there are plenty of restaurants right outside the gates on the main road. Try the Bamki HotplateAs with any holiday you need to reserve your sun lounger early in busy periods but the hotel do their best to help by not allowing towels to be hired until after 9am breakfast. The pools themselves are lovely.The onsite massage parlour is also worth a visit all guests get a free Jet Lag 15 minute massage card but paying for one of the more indepth treatments is well worth itThe overall feel of the place is a relaxing clean friendly environment where you can be at peace away from the hustle bustle of street traders. If you do wish to venture out and see some of the island the hotel can offer good deals on tours to some of the major attractions. This can also all be added to your room bill if you wish to pay at the end of your holiday.Having toured past some of the other hotels on the island I saw no where else that compared to the Puri Santrian and we would definitely go back
35-49,MALE,There isnt a better hotel in NYC I have gone to NYC at least 10 times over the last 4 years. I have stayed at hotels that were rated highly and upon arrival I cringed wondering if the reviews were posted by the hotel staff themselves or crack addicts..But the Affina Dumont This was a little different.All I can say is wow We arrived December 26th at 12:15 PM. Early check-in. No problem. High Floor. No problem. From the doorman to the bellman to the front desk to housekeeping everyone was 100% helpful kind and gracious. Not only upon arrival but the entire 7 days we stayed there.And they remained so while checking out and saying goodbye.All I know is from now on when I go to NYC the Affina Dumont is where I plan on staying.The neighborhood is great. Good bars restaurants groceries etc. Plus if you shop and find you have a lot to bring home there us a UPS Store up the street. You can drop off all your goodies and they will box it up and ship it back to you.You can walk around town easily from here. I actually walked from Kitchen to the hotel one day at it was a pleasant walk.The 6 line is around the corner and if you know how to use the subway you can get anywhere you want easily.I really cannot say enough about this hotel.Go and stay there. You will not be disappointed.
18-24,FEMALE,Beautiful beautiful beautiful The beach stretched for miles
50-64,FEMALE,PRIVATE AND COMFORTABLE WOW-They gave us a wonderful executive suite and it was very quiet. It was a 10 minute walk from the train station. This particular hotel does not offer lotion so bring your own and they also run out of face towels. Housekeeping is not that great we had to go behind them to clean things off. Its an older building and the ceilings in the room are low so I wouldnt suggest anyone over 6 feet to stay in the executive suite and it also does not offer a bathtub but a huge shower. But this hotel is centrally located to everything and I would stay there again. I would also not suggest using there internet from the room it may not connect  but they do have a business office on the first floor. Jose the Concerige was very nice and accomodating and made our stay very nice.
35-49,MALE,Opaque pricing but still pretty good I like CityInns but their pricing has gone crazy. Their rates change daily and the staff are totally inflexible so my tip would be to book a flexible rate ie one that is cancellable without charge and wait and see if they offer others nearer the date of your stay as we ended up getting a double Club room with taxes and breakfast normally GBP 19.50 per person for GBP 119 per night with 4 drinks vouchers worth GBP 9.75 each thrown in and a late check out till 4 pm worth at least 25 quid. This was the Summer in the City special.Club rooms are no bigger than normal rooms but do give you a better class of service / attention. One moan: why do they offer you a 4 pm checkout and then have housekeeping knocking you up at 10 amLocation is great staff pretty friendly though some of them lack basic English dont know what a bathrobe or dressing gown is for example dont know what brown sauce is. I always try and stay here but Ive had my fingers burned with non-refundable rates at other CityInns so thought Id share my experiences
35-49,FEMALE,Wish I could live in Hotel Pulitzer Bathroom
35-49,FEMALE,Wonderful hotel Stayed at the Marriott for 6 nights from Dec 23rd which was our first time in New York.The cab ride from JFK was a bit hair raising to say the leastAnyway upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted by a very nice guy behind the desk who had noted my request for Statue of Liberty views which we were given.The room itself was lovelyspotless and comfortable.We found the hotel to be spotless throughout and very welcoming.The concierge guy was a bit of a misery but the rest of the staff were very pleasant.Found the 2 restaurants to be a bit pricey$5 for a small glass of orange juice at breakfast so we used Starbucks after that.The only complaint would be the elevators.On our last day we waited 20 mins for them and it seemed only one of the three were working.When we did finally squeeze into one with our luggage it stopped at every single floor from the 31st down.All in all it took almost 30 mins to get down.We would go back to the Marriott and i would recommend it if you dont mind paying a little more.
35-49,FEMALE,Cant wait to return Fabulous hotel. After staying at this hotel I cant imagine staying anywhere else in SF. Rooms luxurious and despite the size of the hotel you would think you were alone.No noise from other hotel users. Enjoy.
65-XX,FEMALE,Great price and location We spent 3 days in July at the Columbus Motor Inn and found it clean and quiet. Staff very helpful and the location cannot be beat. We asked for a quiet room. It came without a view but it was blissfully quiet Would definitely stay there again.
35-49,MALE,Nice but some issues as well room 3101: beds
25-34,FEMALE,Loved it I stayed in Vitale per one week and Ive to say I loved every minute of it. The room isnt very large but its very comfortable especially the bed sheets.The only thing I have to object about the room is the lack of 2 chairs in which 2 people can sit to have breakfast I ordered room service together.The room was not at all noisy I think we might have gotten the partial bay view rooms.When we arrived the room wasnt ready yet and they told us that you would be ready at 3 oclock. We came in at 3.30 pm but the room was still not ready. However they offered us a drink at the bar until the room was ready took about half an hour.I especially apreciated the hotel internet service: it has 4 computers with free internet access and a printer so if you dontt have your laptop with you youre still able to access internet.The location was great for me has it was close to the financial center and near the BART/muni station. ~However if you plan to shop and youre looking for a more lively area at night you should stay near Union Square lots of hotels there.
65-XX,MALE,Great Time - Family Friendly Pool view from balcony.
35-49,FEMALE,Nice resting spot We have stayed at the Hilton at Boston Logan Airport every year during our annual trip to the Carribean. The skywalk is a great alternative to the hotel shuttle however the shuttle does run every 10-15 minutes. Check in was easy and pleasant. We ordered room service which was VERY good it arrived on time and hot. We had a very early flight out the next morning and the ZIP CHECKOUT made our departure all the easier. One call to an automated line and we were on our way. I was a tad concerned when we returned as our flight was delayed and we didnt get in until 1:00 a.m. I had not requested a late check and was concerned that perhaps they didnt hold our room. No need to worry they did. Even at 1:00 a.m. they had plenty of front desk staff to attend to us as well as other travelers. Room service was even available at that hour and again the food arrived on time and hot. The Hilton is a nice resting spot in between flights and we will stay there again in the future.
65-XX,MALE,Uninviting. We reserved for the Shinjuku Star and paid for the whole stay in advance.We passed through Tokyo in our way to Kyoto we were going to Tokyo and the Star afterwards and we visited the Star Hotel:noisy worn out poor illumination etc. It was quite unappealing and we rushed to a computer to cancel our reservation even when it meant losing some money. It was worth it. We foundwithout a problem a nice place nearby and more or less at the same price. echel. Mexico.
50-64,MALE,Great Midwinter Vacation Spot We were at the Iberostar Bavaro 2/26/05-3/05/05. We traveled via a charter with TNT from Boston. This resort was great overall and I would definitely go back. We are a couple in our 50s and went with one other couple.Arrival: Our charter go us to the hotel at about 10:30 at night. We were very tired from a long day of travel and anticipated a tedious check in process. We were wrong. The hotel made check in a breeze. They had a manila folder all set for us with keys towel cards resort information and a registration card. We were told to simply get our bracelets put on by the friendly girl waiting for us adjacent to the check in desk and bring back the completed registration card at our convenience. We attached the supplied luggage tags to our bags got our bracelets and got a drink at the bar. Once the entire group got settled with drinks on comfortable couches in the lobby a registration clerk came over and explained the ins and outs of the hotel tom us all. We knew that we wanted a safe key so when he was done we filled out the registration card and returned it to the desk at which time we got our safe key. Having finished our drinks we wandered down to our room and got there just as the bell men arrived with our luggage. One of the easiest check ins ever. By the way they informed us that they were opening up the buffet restaurant for us at 11:00 pm for burgers hot dogs cold cuts and snacks as they assumed we were all hungry from our trip. The burgers were greatRoom:We did try to get upgraded to a room overlooking the beach but were told that none were available as some German tour group had paid extra to reserve them. We had e-mailed them a week in advance and made our request again when we were checking in. They offered a room overlooking the pool to the couple we were traveling with but they did not bother moving as it was not much different than the one they had.Bavaros rooms are all junior suites. Ours was on the ground floor just over the bridge from the main buffet restaurant and was very quiet. We did not notice any musty or other smells as others have reported. We left a couple of bucks for the maid each day and our room was always well cleaned and the mini fridge was always restocked with what we want. The safe is good sized and worked just fine. One day we had difficulty locking our sliding door to the balcony so we called the desk and they had someone there in ten minutes who fixed it on the spot. Beach:Fantastic I cannot say enough good things about it. This is a large resort with lots of beachfront so if you want a lot of activity all day just camp out in front of the pool. The Star Friends will keep you appraised of whats going on all day long. If you want peace and quiet just walk a little ways to the left or right and you will be left alone. The sand here is very fine the water warm the views are gorgeous and there are lots of beach walkers going by most of the day.Food Drink:We really enjoyed the variety of food offered. There was never a time we could not find something good to eat. In fact we made a game out of trying something new every meal. Some we loved some we didnt but there was plenty of variety. We only ate two dinners at the buffet restaurant because we wanted to try the specialty restaurants. Both times were very good. There are steaks and chops available every night that are grilled to your order as well as a pasta station and fajita station. Frankly if you cannot find something to your liking here you should not be going to an all inclusive resort. We tried the Steakhouse restaurant good sirloins done just as ordered; the Mediterranean fish that even non fish eaters can like and the Japanese excellent-the best of the specialty restaurants. We were also invited to a Managers Special Dinner one night at the Mediterranean where we had a choice of lobster or chicken. Both were delicious. Drinks were typical tropical fare nothing especially good or bad though it should be noted that they premix the most popular fruity drinks like Pina Coladas in big dispensing machines. They are not made individually in blenders but they are good.The beer was a local brand only.Shows:There is a show nightly. They seemed to alternate between fancy shows put on by the Star staff and follies shows involving the guests embarrassing themselves. The follies shows are very funny and the staff shows are OK. The staff sing and dance very enthusiastically. We wandered over to the Dominicana a couple of nights and saw there shows which were essentially the same as Bavaros. There is a disco and casino over there. The disco is fun but smoky and we did not try the casino.Shopping:There are stores at the hotel and a collection of flea-market type shops a short walk down the beach. Check out the prices at the hotel and then go down to the flea market to bargain if youre so inclined. Otherwise just buy things at the hotel. The prices there are set so no bargaining.Sickness:Bring Imodium. Two of our foursome had some minor stomach distress one was brushing his teeth with tap water. Imodium took care of it and neither missed more than one meal. Two of us opted for anti-malarial medication chloraquine prior to the trip but we only saw a couple of mosquitoes one evening while watching a show. We did notice them fogging for bugs one day. Overall:I would go back in a minute. We had a great vacation. Iberostar understands how to do the all-inclusive vacation and does it very well. We only speak English and had no problem communicating with the staff. We tried our best to use simple Spanish phrases and the effort seemed appreciated by the staff my attempts at Spanish brought lots of smiles. The resort is beautiful the staff is friendly and attentive and the beach is the best. Go-enjoy
35-49,MALE,Good Hotel in Good Location The Wall
50-64,FEMALE,Nice but cannot quite understand the hype We just returned from a four-night stay at the Artus. The main reason we booked the hotel was because of all of the rave reviews it received from other Trip Advisor users. Frankly we do not understand what all the hype is about. The superior double room was clean with a good size bed. However the room was in need of paint and sprucing up. The service we received was nothing special and actually the day staff was not that helpful. The breakfast was adequate nothing more. It did not vary at all from day to day. Most importantly there is something lacking in atmosphere. In fact the hotel although colorful and artsy is still kind of cold. The location is the best part of the hotel
25-34,MALE,Great Hotel and Location. My girlfriend and I stayed here for my Birthday in March for 5 nights. I would definetley recommend the hotel. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a Studio without even asking Room was spacious nice bathroom kitchen area was small but convenient bed was very comfy and room was ample with a nice LCD TV. No negatives at all - however light sleepers may not like the street noise - but get real its New York not some place out in the wild westLocation is great as theres subway system on thre corner of street which gets you downtown. Nice Mexican down the 51st called Dos Caminos - recommend.Staff were very helpful and friendly. Didnt really use the amenities but the bar was nice and reasonable - Tuesday night free Margaritas We did use room service but it was quite expensive $60 for two omlettes and one tub of Hagen Dazs But we were hungry at 3am and it was niceAll in all great hotel for price and cant recommend it enough.
50-64,FEMALE,Satisfactory Took a vacation to San Francisco July 19 - 22. Adante Hotel was where we stayed. It was a pretty small room but we were only there to sleep and take showers. For the budget it was ok. The front desk clerks Mark Tony were very helpful. The free continental breakfast was not so good could be better. Had a problem with our sink but reported it to the maid and when we got back it was fixed. I had nightmares about the noise but we were put in the back on the second floor and it was very quiet. We even had our window open. I would stay again here when I go back to San Francisco. Very convenient to everything.Vangie F.Georgia
65-XX,FEMALE,Miramar -- Great Location Service  Quality and Price Standard room at the Miramar
65-XX,MALE,Fantastic value for money Booked with Superbreak for BB a night. Got a double room on the 26th top floor with fantastic views. The staff were as good as you can get location 100 yards from the tube true 4 star. Superb breakfast selection.If only British hotels could match this price and serviceYou can always find little faults if you want to but the main thing is that this is a great hotel and for value for money you will not beat it.Barcelona rates as one of the best cities ever visited couldnt do it all and will have to go back. Will stay here again without any boubt.Carol and Phil Oswestry.
35-49,FEMALE,Casablance saves the trip Beware when you book on line I had booked this hotel via the Trip Advisor web site and received a confirmation from Travelocity telling me that I had got the deluxe room I had asked for. A special occasion I was taking my husband via the Queen Mary 2 to NY for our wedding anniversary break. The transatlantic sail was perfect the ship sublime the suite perfect and we arrived at the hotel in a limo along with a great deal of luggage Confirmation in hand we trooped to reception...only to find that they had no record of our booking Yes the bookers had told us we had a room but neglected to tell the hotel who were now full...leaving us stranded  this happens a lot we were told...so always check you have a booking...a confirmation with this company means very little We were stuck No hotel A great deal of luggage and no room at the busiest time for Christmas shopping in NY...it looked like the fantastic climax to our trip was ruined. However the boys at the Casablanca were fantastic Nick and the chaps immediately juggled bookings made calls put themsleves out and after a short wait found us a room in their hotel and had promised to find one elsewhere if they could not help us as they were very full It wasnt the deluxe room I wanted they apologised the room would be small and not their best but I was so grateful for the fantastic service we said yes The room was great If that is the worst I look forward to staying in the deluxe when we next stay in NY It was comfortable well decorated and available straight away 11am On top of that Nick took copies of all my paper work and has been great about chasing up the problem with me...really taking joint ownership when he really had no need. The hotel deserves all the praise you read in the reviews...coffee juices and buns and biscuits available all day and a great cheese and wine evening except Sundays. Breakfast is good too and though the hotel is just off Time Sq we had an undisturbed trip and we were ideally located for shopping theatre and everything else NY. Booking restaurants taxis etc was no problem for the hotel and they really went out of their way to make sure we were happy and comfortable after our unfortunate start...they actually seemed to care about a problem that really wasnt theirs. I have stayed in many hotels in NY and I have to say that this is the best. An originally decorated truly friendly incredibly helpful establishment...I cant praise it enough for everything they did for us. On top of that...its half the price of the places we usually stay where you are pretty much invisable after check in.Thank you Nick and the guys and please members if you book on line even through a great site like Trip Advisor and you get a confirmation...please please call and check I shall not be using Travelocity again...they really didnt care and made no effort to apologise or even respond to my problem.
65-XX,MALE,A Fantastic Discovery Looking down on Japantown from 7th floor of Hotel Tomo
18-24,FEMALE,We had a good time. The hotel was beautiful and the wedding we saw out of our windows were extremely romantic  just in case anyone is looking for a hotel for their ceremony . The beach and the four pools was really great and the service was excellent. Large clean rooms with a very large luxurious bathroom. I loved the little bus that takes you around the territory so you do not feel too bad if you get a room further from the large main pool and the beach. The other four pools were also great and reachable from every room on the territory. Overall highly recommended.
35-49,FEMALE,A very enjoyable experience I normally save my reviews for small independent hotels and guest houses but I felt compelled to write a review of our stay at the Swissotel in response to some of the negative reviews I have read about the place.Our stay wasnt perfect but the problems we encountered were put right without us having to complain. We arrived half an hour before our check-in time and were advised that our room wouldnt be ready for an hour. Obviously this was a little annoying especially when they didnt call us after an hour and when we called them we were told the room still wasnt ready. When we did eventually check-in about an hour and a half after the advised check-in time we were automatically given an upgrade to a Junior Suite. I agree that not having the room ready does not give a good first impression but the quality of the upgrade was more than sufficient compensation.I thought the room was fantastic with views on 3 sides. It was incredibly spacious clean and well-equipped. Two toilets and two huge flat-screen TVs. I dont know what more anyone could ask for. Contrary to what others have said there were plenty of towels throughout our stay and plenty of reading material about Sydney in the room. I dont know these elements differ between the types of room. We also had a problem where one of the porters dropped a wine bag containing two bottles of wine which we had bought in The Hunter Valley for a friends wedding. They were very apologetic and were successful in replacing the wine with the same and better wine from the same vineyard.I do think there is a lack of consistency in the service provided by staff though. It is unfair to say all of the staff were unhelpful as some were helpful beyond the call of duty. This was particularly true of one of the Concierges who could not have been more helpful in assisting us with getting our hire car back to Avis. I wish I could remember his name.We did have a further problem with booking a taxi with another Concierge. We booked it for the Friday evening at 1800 and when we went to get it a different Concierge told us that taxis never turn up on a Friday during rush hour so there was no point booking So again this suggests a lack of consistency amongst the staff.Despite our problems I would still recommend this hotel for the central location and the standard of the rooms.
25-34,FEMALE,Great hotel in a FANTASTIC location We chose the Chesterfield Mayfair for our first trip to London based on trip advisor reviews. We liked the location because the hotel is less than a 5 minute walk to the Green Street tube stop. There too much around the hotel but if you walk a few blocks run into tons of things. We walked very easily to Piccadilly Circus everyday. So the location was fabulous. We had access but none of the fuss Our room was very nice as well. It was very very clean. Housekeeping does a great job. I liked the bathrooms too. Both were just the right size for my husband and I. The staff were very nice as well. They fall over themselves trying to help you. It rained out while we were there and they were always ready with an umbrella or a taxi. We eat in the restaurant; it seemed expensive. We had a few drinks and a dessert in the bar and it converted to almost $50 US. There are two pubs a block away that were fantastic Lion and the Punch Bowl. The hotel was lovely; return if only for the location. One plus left by accident some money out on the dresser. It was there when we returned. highly recommend this hotel
65-XX,MALE,We enjoyed the stay Stayed for 8 days too long for Florence - overload of sights. Our room was large with a standard sized bathroom complete with bath and shower. Large twin beds with very firm mattresses and pillows. Linen sheets changed every day Towels beautiful fluffy white and lots of them. Flat screen tv with BBC world and CNN together with italian and french channels. Breakfast good for Italy depends on needs - cereals bread yoghurts fresh fruit whole cheeses ham crossants fruit juices fresh coffee and tea. Ver friendly and accommodating staff. Location very good for the station and fairly easy to reach all sights. Guide books run down the area as dubious but we did not find a problem. the top graded hotel in tripadvisor is in a very depressing area.We had problems finding hotel so these directions may be helpful. Exit station at the east end of the concourse i.e platforms to the north cross over the extreme north side of the bus station immediately adjacent train station and then cross main road via Val Fonda and carry on the in same direction passed some blue busses in a mini bus station along a back street via Bernardo Cennini 100 yds unitil you reach a T junction with Via Faenza turn right and the hotel is about 100 yds on the right. See previous reviews for suggested restaurants in area although an additional one would be Il Contadino on Via Paluzzulo 71r. Fixed price menu for lunch and dinner mainly locals - no written menu the owner reads it out - 3 courses total for two including wine and coffee simply prepared but as good as other restaurants. For a break from Florences constant traffic noise try Lucca for the day walled city with plenty to look at with peace thrown in. Try Paris restaurant fixed price menu near the Palazzo Pfanner.
25-34,MALE,Amazing view over the bay kitshy deisgn but great if you like that spend 4 days there for business. try to get a room with a view over the bay: I was overlooking Alcatraz Prison the hotel has a great history as it is probably one of the first luxurious hotel of SF. Many famous people from US president to actors came there. You feel the history with the rococo design. a bit kitschy but perfect for a romantic stay and great if you like this kind one hotel which reminds you the French Riviera. The staff was very helpful. the rooms are big bathrooms nice with bath and shower 32 LCD TVs. the lobby is huge with lots of private space if you need to meet people. There is a bar where you can have a big breakfast in the morning or have a drink later in the day. there is also another bar in the former swimming pool with an Tahitian theme where you can have cocktails or diner. didnt try the food but the cocktail were good and pricey as it is a first class hotel. the gym is ok but you have to pay sthg like $10 or $15/day. the hotel in on top of a hill so if you are a lazy type person you will have to take a cab or the tramway to come back or find another hotel downtown it s a 5 min cab ride to go downtown and there are always cabs waiting at the entrance. the concierge has great restaurant recommendations. indicated me an awesome tapas place in the Spanish area. I would definitely come back even if they lack a pool....I was there in the winter so not so inconvenient.last thing: have a drink in the hotel next door in the tower: great view over SF
35-49,FEMALE,There are better places to stay in Singapore Although not terrible there are a lot better hotels for the same price to stay in in Singapore. The hotel room was very dated and not as clean as it could have been. There was a patch of damp in the bathroom too - in its time this was probably a nice hotel its just a shame its time was about 30 years agoThe location too could pose a problem for some people. It is a 15 minute hilly walk to the main Orchard Road area and the nearest MRT station. Although this may not seem far in the heat and humidity of Singapore it is a very hot and sweaty experience.I have stayed in Singapore 3 times now and this was by far the worst hotel I have stayed in. The Orchard Parade hotel and the Phoenix no swimming pool were a much better class of hotel and far better located. There are some alterations going on at the Elizabeth at the moment - maybe it will be better then but for now I would choose somewhere else.
65-XX,FEMALE,Noisy old hotel My cousine and I spent the nights of December 20 and 21 at the Lodge. We came from Boston for the funeral of my brother. Upon arrival we were very tired and worn out based on the circumstances. On checking in we specifically asked at the desk for a quiet room and were assured that would be the case. We were given rooms in between as it turned out a noisy family with children. We were disturbed on both nights with crying the the adjoining door and loud talking and television. We tried to be patient but my cousin finally knocked on their door and asked them to control their children and quiet down. It helped some.In addition I ordered a side order of toast from Room Service both mornings. The first morning the toast came barely toasted on a plate covered by a paper napkin with no jelly no knife and no napkins. I called back to ask for these basic items. On Friday morning the toast came with jelly but no knife and no napkins. Ob check-out we complained and were given a $25 discount. I followed up with the manager and was offered a free night on our next stay. Since we will never again be in Studio City I found that unacceptable and asked for a credit. After many follow-up emails and a very long delay the manager offered another $25 discount gain not acceptable. Hence I have decided to post a review.Aside from our specific complaints Lodge is an old and tired motel looks it and acts it shabby around the edges etc. It is one to be avoided.
25-34,MALE,Superb Bargain hotel This is how all Novotel Novation hotels should be. I really could not fault this at all. Got a fantastic rate of GBP25.00 per night on [--] and this is brilliant value for money especially when one thinks of how overpriced UK hotels are compared to what you can get in Berlin.Hotel is situated on Strasse des 17 Juni right by Tiergarten S-Bahn station. Having stayed in a few Berlin Hotels this is no problem to get around anywhere regardless of the other reviews you may have read on here about this being out of the way. The Hauptbahnof is 5 minutes away Alexanderplatz is 10 mins away. Bahnhof Zoo is 2 mins away by S-Bahn. If this is out of the way i dread to think what areas like Pankow Wilmersdorf and Charlottenberg are for some peopleHotel lobby and corridor areas are modern although in typical Novotel standard they are modern without being too flashy. The rooms are of a nice standard about 27 Square metres with TV honesty minibar Tea and coffee making facilities shower and seperate bath. Seperate toilet too in the room.Plenty of storage space In room safe and a quiet interior room I really couldnt fault this at all.For a hotel amongst the same star rating as the Park Plaza WallStrasse its not as nice  but its equally on a par with the Park Inn in Alexanderplatz or the Novotel Berlin Mitte or Suitehotel at Potsdammer Platz.Rack rate at this hotel is about 145EUR per night which is reasonable considering what you are getting. Try getting a similar standard in a UK hotel for the same price turning up on the dayTop tip is to skip the buffet breakfast at 17 Euro and go across to the Wiener Fierbacker across the road and have a continental breakfast for a 2-3 Euros.This is without doubt the best Novotel I have had the pleasure of staying in
25-34,MALE,Serviceable tiny room We are Gold Preferred Guests and stayed in the hotel using points. So to preface everything when you get something for free you cant really complain TOO much about it. If I had paid $400/night for the room we stayed in it would have been completely unacceptable. The room was in the middle of the three wings of the now-combined resort and it was TINY. It did have a somewhat-ocean view out of a small side window but otherwise the room was dominated by the king-size bed. Beyond that there was barely room to walk around. Compared to other Hawaii properties i.e. the Hilton Hawaiian Village which cost less this room just did not cut it. However it was clean and had a good bed. We also chose this property primarily because a it was free and b it was easy to drive from there to good beaches in Oahu that arent Waikiki. That said otherwise this property was a solid Westin property. Staff were very courteous including superior service at valet parking which was our main concern. As I noted before I used to live on Oahu and fortunately I already knew that Waikiki is the worst beach on this island and as far as I know throughout Hawaii. Although it has all of the tourist hotels really if you want a great experience on Oahu use Waikiki as your home base and drive the 15-20min to other secluded beaches on the island. Since that was our plan we mostly used the hotel for breakfast where is a great buffet for $30 $18 if you only eat cold food/continental. We also relaxed sometimes on the veranda in the middle of the property where the pool and the excellent pool bar are. It is a beautiful area and one of the nicer layouts of the Waikiki properties. Compared to the Hilton the Westin was also thankfully bereft of kids which since we dont have kids it was our honeymoon was important to us. The property is in excellent condition overall and the fitness facility while a bit tough to find its on the 32nd floor of the Sheraton tower which is actually the 2nd floor though not marked that way and the signage is not great was up to par and had all-new equipment. In sum if I had a room with a balcony that was larger than a thimble I would definitely stay in the Westin again. I would also stay there for free regardless. But if I were paying their not-cheap rates I would have been angry at the size of our room but happy with everything else.
18-24,FEMALE,Best Place in the World This August will be my 5th time staying at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. This is my favorite place to stay in Hawaii because it is so beautiful and unique from all the other hotels. All of the rooms are gorgeous- even coming from someone who had a non-ocean view room half of the time The hotel is just the right size- they have some cute boutiques beauty services and amazing restaurants. They offer shuttles to many of the nearby attractions and their service is always so efficient. I love the Royal Hawaiian and would never stay anywhere else on my vacations in Oahu
35-49,FEMALE,Loved the new hotel I travel to phoenix a couple of times a year to visit my ailing Mom. The last time we came the hotel was completely under construction and we left before even staying there. We returned this year and were pleasantly surprised to find how well the hotel turned out. They completely redid everything. There was even new furniture out by the pool which my kids enjoyed since it was much to cold to swim where we are from. The new expanded fitness center with all new equipment was a plus for my husband and I was happy just to have a quite breakfast in my room. Food was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating. We didnt have to worry about a thing the whole time we were there. You must give this hotel a chance...you will be thoroughly satisfied.
65-XX,FEMALE,Good hotel but not really a Seattle experience We live in the Seattle area and booked this hotel because of the wind damage and we were without power for more than a week. We stayed here for 3 of those nights in two different rooms. I guess I was surprised that this hotel was rated so high as most locals have not even heard of it. We only knew about it because our son does not live far from here.The hotel was totally booked during this time period because so many people were without power. The front desk people were overwhelmed because of all the calls etc. but they handled it very well. The rooms are good size the bathrooms are very nice. It is done rather modern style - but not cold. The restaurant downstairs does mainly appetizer type food but the soups/salads etc. are very tasty. They have wine tasting in the evening but it is not like the Kimpton Hotels - you get a voucher which allows you to have a small tasting of a red and a white wine. Would I stay here again? Yes if my power went out. But if I were a tourist coming here to Seattle for the first time? No. This hotel is a distance from downtown Seattle - 10 minutes by car when traffic is good. Is there anything else in the neighborhood? No. If you have a child or relative that is going to the University of Washington and you are here to see them and be involved in their activities - this is the perfect place for you. If you are here to experience what the vibe of Seattle is - pay an extra $50 if you can and stay downtown Seattle. It is so different. The restaurants within walking distance of downtown hotels are incredible. There are excellent restaurants in this same area as the Watertown Tilth but it is a cab ride. Also as one of the previous reviewers stated - if this hotel is full - it is noisy. We were about 5 doors from the elevator but I could hear it bling everytime the elevator hit our floor. Also the people above us must have had children that were busy - they hit the floor at 6AM and it sounded like floor hockey above us for the next 2 hours until they took them for breakfast. If you arent on one of the top floors looking south - you look at a busy street.This area is an interesting area of Seattle. We love it and have bought a condo in this area where we plan to eventually move. However it is an area of transition - it is not a typical area of Seattle. There is not much to do or see here - you are dependent on transportation to see the tourist sights. That is why I would recommend this hotel as a hotel but this is not what I would like you to think all of Seattle represents.
65-XX,MALE,Anniversary stay We live on Oahu but decided to spend our 19th wedding anniversary at the Waikiki Circle Hotel. We had stopped in a couple of times and were able to see a room each time we visited. The staff is the friendliest weve come across in a long time especially Naomi and Steve. We requested a high floor ocean front because the view cannot be beaten. Its true the rooms are small however there is a refrigerator and a large closet with a mirrored door. They are tastefully decorated bright and have been updated with 32 HDTV televisions. It was clean and didnt smell like other reviews had mentioned. The bathroom is also small but there is some exaggeration with regard to the size of the showers my wife and I managed to both fit quite well at the same time.
50-64,MALE,Great Hotel for the Heavy Sleeper Just a short weekend stay turned up early and although the room wasnt ready they stored our luggage for us and when we returned had moved us down a couple of floors not sure if it was an upgrade but it was a nice room very clean. Comfortable beds with four choices of pillow large bathroom. Staff were very polite and helpful. Would have scored excellent had it not been for the noise. Something I was aware of because of the proximity of nightclubs in Rembrant Square. Great location though in the heart of Amsterdam within 10-20 minutes walking distance of virtually all attractions. So if you are a heavy sleeper or just out partying all night then this is the perfect place for you.
65-XX,MALE,Six Stars if Possible View from our room
25-34,FEMALE,Great Vacation A cool thing about our buffet was that there was always food sculpture like this or carved melo
18-24,FEMALE,IBERO STAR BAVARO - GORGEOUS This was a surprise bday gift from Hubby...Although we only stayed for 5 days 4 nights I must say this was a fantastic getaway from baby furbaby :From the minute we landed to the day we left everything was simply perfect and smoothThe entire grounds were breathtakingly beautiful the staff was extremely friendly the entertainment was uplifting the food was plentiful delish and most importantly the weather was perfectHubby and I spent most of our days working on our tans and relaxing by the beach..Okay also the bar which was a swim-up.It was nice to see that it was very family friendly-but certainly not like Disneyland...The kids were well behaved and there was plenty of space to keep to themselves. It was our first time at an all inclusive vaca and I dont know if Ill ever do otherwise : This is definately one well be coming back to
50-64,MALE,one of the best ever my wife and i have stayed in some wonderful hotels the world overbut never have we stayed in a hotel with staff as good as those at Casa Camper.thank you so much for being so helpful and pleasent and especially for the little surprises left in our room on hearing of the surprise we got from our son when he told us on the roof terrace that we were to become grandparents it was truly very touching thank you so much to all concerned oh and the hotel itself is fantastic by the way great location and enjoyed the 24 drinks and snackssee you soon i hope
25-34,FEMALE,very far from the centre barcelona itself is absolutely fabulous. Me and my friend both 24 have just come back we had a great time with all the sights shopping and sangria. but the biggest downfall was how far away the hotel is we were always in taxis  of a day its fine to walk but as its on a back street we felt it unsafe to walk of a evening. would reccomend people to stay closer to the centre. x
25-34,FEMALE,DF dulce DF Great location We also loved the modern clean design of the hotel and the professional courteous and competent staff. The rooms were clean and large and I highly recommend the rooftop pool to cool down after a busy day in the city. My only complaints - the bed might be a little firm for some tastes the hotel has a definite business traveler vibe and you might have to ask for more towels.
35-49,FEMALE,this is our hotel when we come to ny to stay we always stay at the palace. the best for value service room size cleanliness and luxury. the best deals are on the weekend with included parking and breakfast. its location is central. the room views are great. we love the lobby and the villiard room bar. we stayed here with and without our kids. staying in sept. cant wait
35-49,FEMALE,Beautiful resort but... This resort has received many recent reviews so I dont want to repeat what has been already stated- Everything positive that is written about the hotel common areas beach and service is totally accurate. As you walk around the resort you truly feel like you are their most important guest in paradise. The staff goes above and beyond remembering small details about your preferences. With that said you should know:Getting there- We booked through Spirit Air Vacations and had no problems. Transfers to and from the hotel with VIP were friendly and on-time. Rooms- Pretty to look at but with hard beds and poor bedding. As stated in other reviews the resort has constant problems with AC. Our first room on the 3rd floor was sweltering. We asked to move after one night and ended up on the ground floor. Much better After speaking to other guests it appears that the lower floors are generally cooler. Activities / entertainment - If youre an active person theres a lot to do on the resort during the day. Most activities are arranged through the Scuba shop. Go early in the morning to arrange what youd like to do. We tried windsurfing sailing on a catamaran and snorkeling which are all free. If you want to take the banana boats you negotiate a price directly with the operators. The resort also has water aerobics and games throughout the day. If you prefer to relax there are plenty of chairs and excellent wait service around the pool under the palms and on the beach. Evening entertainment was decent too. The casino was small but fun as was the club. Both dont get going until around midnight. We didnt attend any of the shows.Riu properties- As a guest of the Palace Macao youll have a wristband that allows you to enjoy the other 4 Riu properties with the exception of the other Palace. We enjoyed visiting adjacent properties two of which had swim-up bars. Those hotels appeared to have a more party atmosphere. Still it was nice to return to the elegance of the Macao.Beach - Beautiful clear water and soft sand. Great for swimming. Reefs just offshore with a variety of marine life. While snorkeling was saw rays barracuda flounder and numerous colorful reef fish. Bring a mug or tumbler with a lid so that you can keep your drinks cool and sand-free while at the beach. The waiters are happy to refill them for you. Food- Not for me. I hesitate to be too critical since everyone else in my party was able to find at least a few things to enjoy each meal but it just didnt suit my palate. Most items were in heavy sauces or dressings. I was surprised at the lack of fresh vegetables and fish choices. The a la carte restaurants with the exception of the Japanese restaurant were a disappointment. I thought that by going with the a la carte the food would be cooked-to-order. However most items appeared and tasted like they had been sitting for quite some time. The Japanese restaurant was pretty good. Drinks- Unlimited including a regularly re-stocked minibar in your room. Pepsi products. Mixed drinks - most drinks are fruity and very sweet. Wine selection was not good. Presidente beer is tasty but not stocked in your room.Liquor is generally bottom-shelf but you can get better brands if you request it. You must pay for drinks in the night club but theyre not expensive. Misc- We tipped throughout our stay mainly because the service was so wonderful. Also most of the staff speak very limited if any English so brush up on your Spanish. Even learning a few phrases with help you communicate and get to know your hosts better. One last thing-I strongly suggest you read the forums at this site to get more helpful tips. I dont think our vacation would have gone as well without the valuable info we got from the forums.
50-64,MALE,Fantastic stay at the Monaco The Seattle Hotel Monaco holds up the high standards of the Kimpton hotel line. Having stayed at Kimpton hotels in several other cities I can easily say that the Seattle Hotel Monaco is one of the best I have seen. The service is attentive and very prompt. Based on being a member of the Kimpton loyalty program I was upgraded to a 10th floor room with a great view of 4th street and the excellent public library kitty-corner across from the hotel. I highly recommend a tour of the public library; you will be blown away. My room is quite spacious with a beautiful flat-screen television with DVD/CD player. The exercise room is pretty standard Kimpton size which means adequate but not outstanding: four eliptical cardio machines and two stationary bikes each with personal viewing screens. The cardio machine screens accept DVDs which I have not seen elsewhere. As with all Kimpton hotels and the Hotel Monaco line in particular the hotels lobby is stylish quirky and inviting. Its easy to imagine spending time relaxing in the comfortable over-stuffed chairs. The restaurant attached to the hotel Sazerac is very good. So far I have eaten lunch there and look forward to breakfast tomorrow. As always with Kimpton properties I am able to connect to the free highspeed internet by ethernet in seconds and am cruising the web and checking email back at the office with no problems. In my opinion you cant go wrong with any Kimpton hotel and the Seattle Hotel Monaco is certainly an excellent choice.
50-64,FEMALE,What an awesome place...... 4 of us age range from 14 to 50 went to this hotel with much concern after reading all the reviews. i spent about a month researching this area hotel and considered changing the trip after reading all the negative comments. i am a pretty seasoned traveler and realized that i was going to a 3rd world very poor country and took that all into consideration. we americans need to realize that not everyone lives the luxury lives that we have here in the USA. as is also the case in many other countries. i think our children also need to realize how other parts of the world live and appreciate all the things they take for granted as well as learn of other cultures. all this aside i want to say that i cannot believe all the negative i have read on this hotel in particular. when we arrived we were met by our travel agency guide noel from turinter company... he spent well over an hour telling us of things to do got us a welcome drink spoke to and arranged our check-in with the front desk personnel--he was beyond wonderful to us and made us feel so welcome . he also even placed calls to the USA for my daughter as we speak no spanish. we were then taken to our rooms and when my daughter friend went to their room they walked in on a couple already assigned to that room. fortunately they were getting ready to go to dinner so no harm done  we went to the desk and they immediately assigned them to another room down the hall.... OK it was an inconvenience but the people were super about it even talked to us every day after that and the desk profusely apologized. mistakes happen and yes we could have let it ruin our trip but we chose to overlook it go on and enjoy our trip. from that point on i could only walk around in total amazement at the well kept grounds the warmth we felt from all the staff the food and food displays the ammenities the beach pool areas etc. i am a very picky eater and can honestly say that we always found more than enough that was satisfactory to us. granted there were things on the buffet that were not our choice but we were not the only people there  we did not drink the tap water and had no problem with getting sick. we tried several times to make reservations to go to the specialty restaurants but it never happened so no big deal we will do that another time  i am not sure where these people writing bad reviews stayed but i cannot believe that it is the same place we were at. we have a place in cancun that we love usually vacation at but opted not to this year. we thought we would never find a place that we would love more but i think we have found that place in DR. please consider that everyones expectations are different and if you expecte a 5* americanized hotel all american food do yourself the DR a favor stay home  our maids were super... we left gifts and tips for them every day and always had a clean room towels extra water and they were so appreciative of what we left them nail polish bracelets cosmetics a couple dollars a small purse perfume chocolate candy. i left a couple things each day. .... we took school supplies for the schools but school was out so we passed the stuff on to the staff that had children as well as some of the people at the market next to the resort. the last morning we were there our maid came to our door with 2 coconuts drilled at the top with a straw so you could drink the coconut milk and flowers coming out of the top with a note written on the side thanking us for everything... it was very sweet  i hope you think about what you expect then go and enjoy yourself. we could not have asked for a better trip and experience and will definitely go back . the only thing i personally think this hotel could do better with is their choice of drinks....... i do not drink beer and after the first day the pina coladas and banana mamas got to be too much sweet for me. i would have been in heaven if i could have had a kaluha and cream but Oh well i didnt so no big deal. it would also be nice if there was bottled water available in other places besides just your room but again you cant have every thing and i would still go back in a heart beat 
50-64,FEMALE,Wonderful rooms and beds at the Donatello We have just completed a one week stay at the Donatello and loved it. The rooms are large and clean and the beds king size are superbly comfortable The colour scheme is royal blue and orange - it sounds weird but it really works. The bathrooms are good and there is good storage space in the bathroom and the room in general. Rooms have a microwave fridge coffee maker dishes and cutlery - tea coffee and sugar are supplied.The staff especially Jesus couldnt have been more helpful and friendly.The only problem we had was noise from the nightclub on Mason St but Jesus moved us to another room and then all was well. Dont stay in a room overlooking MasonThe restaurant is wonderful but not cheap.
35-49,FEMALE,Relaxing and gracious Our favortie spot
65-XX,FEMALE,great small hotel in waikiki The pool for the Equus
50-64,MALE,Classic Hotel Situated on the bank of the Arno River and within easy strolling distance of the city centre. The Ponte Vecchio Bridge is about half mile along the river bank from the hotel.Impressive lobby area with lots of marble and period furniture. Concierge desk very helpful on anything you want to see and gives good supply of maps for free. Reception staff are also very helpful.Bedrooms have high ceilings and match the of the hotel lobby. Beds are very comfortable and have super soft pillows. Bathrooms are all marble with frosted glass door separating the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. Air conditioning is efficient in cooling the room We went May 2005. Notice on window warning of opening of windows because of mosquitoes and midges. My wife was bitten.The Donatello bar has a full range of drinks and draught beers. Drinks are expensive but you get a full range of nuts and crisps plus small pizza squares in the evening. IL Cesptello restaurant is expensive but the food is very good. Wine list expensive but you can get wine of the region at 26 Euro per bottle and also wine by the glass.Lots of small restaurants nearby and serving sandwiches and pizza. Prices here are cheaper and you can sit outside on the pavement tables but watch the mozzies.
35-49,MALE,service through gritted teath On arrival we were delighted to be told that we had been upgraded to a club floor room. The room itself was small the bathroom tiny and the decor and lighting were poor. Internet access was available for a reasonable fee. After a long flight we were hoping for a lie in sadly this was not to be as despite having the do not disturb sign on the maid ricocheted through the door armed with a vacum cleaner at 8am claiming not to have seen the do not distueb sign. A call to receiption failed to get an apology for this so they were not off to a good start. That evening we though we would check out the club lounge only to find out that as upgrades we would be charged for everything in the lounge - I mean that is like getting an airline upgrade to business class and being served economy class food. Bearing in mind we had not asked for the upgrade and it probably only occured becuase the hotel had oversold its standard rooms that came as yet another dissapointment.The service was extreamly average for Singapore food was pretty much ok and in terms of location then the hotel is well placed for all the major shopping and entertainment areas.
25-34,FEMALE,All-Inclusive LAST Resort The beach was beautiful The swim up bar was a lot of fun. But the service was lacking and the rooms were sub-standard. I heard that the experiences in the Royal Service side was much better. A lot of the staff treat you in a condescending manner and its far worse if you dont speak spanish. It was a hot time of year June 27-July 1 so the only place that felt truly delicious was our ACd room some of the people in our party were having AC problems. Some of the restaurants were too warm to drink wine. And thats even if you had a reservation they actually honored. Most of the time we were arguing with someone about our reservations we set. We had made them before we got to the resort confirmed them the night before while at the resort and they still managed to keep us from enjoying dinner where we wanted and when. The buffets were only good if you got there as soon as the food was put out. The mixed drinks were nasty and the wine was pretty bad too. The bars were outdoors and not comfortable at all unless your idea of comfort is sitting in sweltering heat with no moving air around you. The bartenders seemed to see you better if you had cash in hand. There are not enough huts on the beach to seek refuge from the sun and believe me youll need it. After 2 hours my brain felt like it was frying. There were a lot of activities amenities restaurants and just things going on that we never knew about but heard about on the trolley-train circuit that a resort of that size should at the very least have a print out of whats going on where delivered to their patrons rooms daily. We did receive housekeeping but every day it was a different time sometimes not until after 5pm. The casino was just about the only place to go at night but if you dont gamble youre basically just drinking bad alcohol. All the food at this resort tastes the same - soggy and tasteless. But i heard the Japanese was good but by the time we were given reservations i got sick from the food and it was our last night so i did not get a chance to really enjoy. They tell you that there is food at night 9pm buffet style if the A la Carte restaurants do not have enough room but if there are private functions going on you are not permitted to enter leaving you no choice but to buy potato chips or cookies at the gift shop. There was a couple of times we were at the buffet places  which is the only place to go for breakfast and lunch and the place was packed with more employees eating than resort guests leaving the place cramped for space. There were 60 people in our party and not one of our groups were given the dinner reservation that was asked for. The resort staff lied to us numerous times about confirming dinner reservations and changing them without our knowledge to suit other guests at the resort. We found out later that Royal Service guests were given our reservations. The room smelled really bad too. Like moldy damp dirty. The paint on the walls literally comes off with your fingernail its so damp. The shower head didnt work. They left flowers in the room that were dead by the time we ever got the chance to see them they shut off the AC after they clean your room. No room service only the Royal Service side got that. The only good thing about our room was that it was close to the beach pool. The ATM machine only dispenses pesos at the resort although dollars are accepted everywhere. Everything at the gift shop is at least double what you would normally pay in the states. The funny thing about Pina Coladas and other Fruity mixed drinks they advertise not only do they make them different each time different colors textures but we later caught on that if you do not specify whether you want alcohol or not they will give it to you without alcohol. And if you are prone to being bitten by mosquitoes you will be bitten. I came home with 30 bites. I planned on writing far more about Melia Caribe Tropical but realized that we got what we paid for and it wasnt about food service or anything like that for us - it was about bonding with the people we were traveling with. As the saying goes - its not where you are but who youre with that counts. But I do not plan on returning to the Dominican Republic much less this all-inclusive last resort.
25-34,MALE,Excellence in Miami Didnt think it was possible I usually go to Miami a few times a year. For some reason I have never stayed at the FS I have to ask myself why?Having stayed at the Conrad next door and several hotels in South Beach I can say this is the best i have experienced in Miami. Although i have not stayed at the Mandarin OrientalThe hotel is lovely. The lobby and particularly the Botero sculptures are magnificant.We stayed in a premier bay view room - Great views of the bay well executed color scheme and the usual tasteful FS bathroom. If you have a choice get a bay view room. Looking back at the city is not great. Much of Miami downtown is a construction site.Service was excellent. Everyone remembered and pronounced my rather long last name. The restaurant Aqua is pretty good. My mother is a vegetarian- they had no trouble accommodating her requests. The wine list is good and reasonable for a FS.The pool area is well designed and landscaped. The staff is attentive.There is one downside. If you stay here have a car. There is nothing to do downtown that you can walk to. Shop and eat in south beach walk around on lincoln road but stay here.
35-49,FEMALE,Fabulous Location Another exceptional hotel The location was fabulous Surrounded by good restaurants and shopping. Walking distance to almost every major tourist attraction. Our room was very large spotless and had a nice balcony.
25-34,MALE,Prime Location My girlfriend found the Chancellor through TripAdvisor and after looking at a few other places she and I decided this was the place for us. After our stay in late March early April we are not disappointed. The hotel was clean the staff was nice willing to help with whatever we asked - be it directions advice etc and the location is excellent for access to the cable cars buses Chinatown the financial district and of course Union Square. There is a coffee shop next door and a Walgreens just up the block. We bought our MUNI pass at the desk the 3 day pass was the best for us. The rooms are small but not tight. You have a large closet a comfortable bed and you can even pick from a number of pillow types down fiber poly buckwheat bead etc at no extra cost Ive never seen this before - and it was a nice feature. We couldnt get the internet to work for us but that wasnt really an issue since 1 we didnt need to get online much and 2 they have a computer/printer in the lobby for your use. The staff worked to get our computer up and running on their wireless and would have done more if we had wanted. All in all the cost of the hotel is not the cheapest in town but the value is very high due to location amenities and the overall price-point of everything in SF. If we dont stay here again it would only be because we wanted to try another part of town - we have no complaints about the hotel.
50-64,FEMALE,Location and price were the drawing points for our stay... Location and price were the drawing points for our stay at the York. The hotel matched the Orbitz price that we found online. The hotel was very clean. The breakfast was adequate muffins toast bananas apples juice coffee and tea. The walls are thin as stated in an ealier review That could be a problem. One night we slept with the radio tuned in to classical music station. We asked for extra pillows right away as they were quite thin.My daughter in her 30s and I stayed there for a girls trip to San Francisco for five nights. We were only at the hotel to sleep and did not expect it to be a five star hotel. So it worked out just fine. It was an easy walk to Powell Street which is on the main cable line. On arriving from the airport we took the BART in to Union Square rather than a cab the Powell station for $5.15 a piece. That was a bargain Now we did have to walk and drag our luggage quite a few blocks up Powell Street and across Sutter Street. But we knew we would have other things to spend our money on. The hotel is only blocks from Dotties True Blue Cafe an easy walk for a wonderful treat for breakfast. Our wait was only 30 minutes. Not bad A Walgreens is at the corner of Powell and Sutter. That was a convenient locationOne night we enjoyed a Cosmo in the adjoining Plush Room before retiring to our room.All in all staying at the York Hotel added to our fun vacation to San Francisco
35-49,MALE,Not loving the Grand Marina Our second time in Barcelona previously we had stayed at the H10 Montcada and quite enjoyed it. This time around we got what we thought was a great deal and chose to stay on the water. Were still here as I write this but are thinking of cutting our reservation short perhaps to take a train to explore more of Spain.I can see why those about to board a ship would choose this hotel as its literally on the pier where you would board your ship.The hotel design is cool and contemporary but this is where the love stops.Its the little things that are driving me nuts. Our room in on the 7th floor of 8 and weve got a great view with a little tiny balcony that looks out to the city. I really liked this until night came and the winds changed. The sliding doors to the balcony dont seem to close correctly so you get this sporadic wind shrieking as you try to sleep. Perhaps this is something that only happens in the winter?The temperature controls in the room seem useless. No matter how I set it it seems to jump back to 20 Celsius.The only clock in the room is actually part of the flat panel TV. Once you shut off the TV the clock can no longer be seen.We were welcomed on arrival with a small plate of chocolates and some bottled water. Lovely. But for a 5-star luxury hotel it would be nice if they would drop off a bottle of water every day. The only alternative is the min-bars teeny-tiny 330ML bottles - that cost 4 Euros each.We had wine glasses in the room on the first day as well but those seem to have disappeared.Im dying to find out what happens with the bathroom amenities today. We dont seem to be getting anything replenished and are down to one tiny bar of soap that we keep passing between the shower and the sink. It literally feels like the hotel is saying - youve used up your allotment time to check out.On the bright side we did partake in the morning buffet on our second day not included in our package. It was really lovely. But unless youre boarding a cruise ship or maybe if its the middle of summer; Id choose differently.
25-34,FEMALE,Loved it The rooms and the hotel has character Firstly the hotel advertises the rooms are small so no surprises there. On arrival the staff are friendly and will answer any questions you have. Although small the rooms pack a fair amount of punch - they have everything you need They offer free water and coke a cola as well as tea and coffee. The beds are extreemly comfortable and the furnishings are wonderful. I rate this hotel and its staff highly - I will be returning
65-XX,MALE,Delightful Hotel We had a very pleasant 2-night stay at the Kras. Situated on Dam Square opposite the Palace it was a prime location. Bus and tram stops are right across the street so it was easy to get anywhere. The hotel itself was inviting from the lobby onward. We arrived early in the day yet a room was ready for us. It was clean and well appointed. The business center was handy and the front desk staff was pleasant and eager to serve. We would stay again if the occasion arose.
35-49,MALE,Excellent Hotel Room is large and includes free wifi and minibar
50-64,FEMALE,Fabulous Hotel The Intercontinental Hotel in Boston is a brand new hotel that is exactly what you would expect in an Intercontinental Hotel. It was fabulous It is conveniently located near the waterfront and Fanueil Hall as well as other Boston landmarks. The lobby is impressive and the RumBa Bar is a happening spot in the evening We had both breakfast and lunch at their restaurant Miel and it was very good both times. We also had room service which was prompt and the staff was friendly and helpful.The fitness center was a delight with new equipment and you could do both cardio and strength training with everything you need for a decent on the road workout.The bed was comfortable and the pillows were so-so. We had a typical city view with a partial view of the harbor. The bathroom was exceptional with an awesome shower and separate tub. Overall we were very happy at the Intercontinental and would highly recommend it to travelers.
50-64,MALE,fantastic hotel I went to Barcelona last year with a group of mates and we stay at the vincci arena for 4 night. This is great hotel very clean and rooms beautifully decorated. The staff were very friendly and i couldnt ask for more. Location very good and metro only round the corner. For value and quality this hotel is very good.
25-34,MALE,Great but expensive stay We stayed at hotel Bijou for three nights when we first arrived in het USA. To our surprise the hotel was although very centrally located easy to find by car from the airport. There is no parking place at the hotel it self so you can choose from valet parking to other local parking places. Either way it costs al lot of money expect 24-29 USD per 24 hours. That was the only downside.The hotel is very centrally located and a perfect start to explore San Francisco. The rooms are small but clean. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. We left very early  06:00 amat the last day and we could make our own breakfast to take with us. Breakfast is good but simple.If youre looking for an average but very central accomodation dont hesitate.
25-34,MALE,Love this place We found an offer to stay here for and now I love this place Ok the rooms are a little small and the bathrooms dont have a lock but these are minor grumbles. The decor is cool staff really friendly rooms are comfortable and quiet and the bar serves good bourbon. What more can you want? Oh and the locations is fantastic- 5 minutes from the tube and all you need to do to reach the bars of Old Street is fall out of bed. Also you get Pret breakfast delivered to your room in the morning which is a nice touch. Cant wait to stay here again.
25-34,FEMALE,Pretty Good If youre in Amsterdam for a couple of days and want a GREAT location and dont mind a small room this is the place. It is two blocks from the Rjiksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. I walked all over the city from the hotel. The staff are very helpful particularly Martina.The breakfast is so so. Also the hotel is located near the PC shops. If you go there go to the PC Cafe. Im still thinking about the sandwich I had.The rooms are SMALL But the bed was comfortable and it kept me out of my room since I was there to see the city anyway not lay in the lap of luxury. The free internet is also a nice feature.
25-34,MALE,By Singapore Standards... Pretty Bad I know Singapore hotels like the back of my hand. I have stayed dozens of times in Singapore in just about every 5 star hotel on the island and even Sentosa. I am amazed that Sheraton Towers is so high on the popularity index. I have stayed here about 6 times over the past few years and have always been disappointed. The only reason I stay here is that the sales staff are very slow at putting up their rates when big conferences are on which means the Sheraton can be an absolute bargain when other nearby hotels triple their prices.There are two main problems:1. The rooms are small and antiquated by Singapore standards. They are not even in the same ball park as what is on offer at just about every other 5* hotel e.g. Conrad Grand Hyatt etc.. The bathroom is tiny and again very old. In all honesty I have seen better rooms at a 3* Holiday Inn.2. The service is consistently poor from the front desk to the concierge to the room service staff. They just do not care and it shows. The ony friendly person is the guy who opens the door and he was only friendly to return-guests who he recognised. He completely ignored me when I said hello to him.The only thing the Sheraton does as good as the competition is its breakfast buffet which is out of this world.Overall I am perplexed as to why people stay at this hotel. Particularly considering it is as expensive if not more expensive than much better nearby hotels. Even Starwood know it is not up to scratch - this hotel was booted out of Starwoods Luxury Collection a few years agoIf you want this area and a name-brand hotel - stay at the Grand Hyatt just down the road. Ive stayed there many times its much better than the Sheraton.
50-64,FEMALE,Fantastic stay in every way My daughter and I stayed here for 2 nights; it is fantastic. It is family operated and they treat their guests like family. The room was clean and recently renovated but most importantly it was quiet although it is situated only minutes from the Duomo and David. Breakfast is fine nothing fancy. Wonderful location for sightseeing and the bus/train terminal. They gave discount for payment in cash. I would definitely stay here again.
25-34,MALE,Great location fine hotel We arrived on saturday for a three-days trip in Madrid. Since this was our first time there we loved the absolute central location of the Best Western Atlantico hotel: in the city center near the Palace a few steps away from other touristic areas we could not find a better place to stay in Madrid.When we checked in we specifically asked for a room with a view on the street. Based on other reviews on TripAdvisor we knew that some rooms were built towards a very small brick wall. The map for emergency exit that is displayed in the room made it clear to us that this choice was the good choice. However you should know that the Municipal Police is very much active in this part of the town which means that you hear a lot of sirens at any hours on the day or the night. If you care about not being disturbed while sleeping you should definitively choose a room not facing the street as this will probably inconvenient you. Also we booked originally a smoking room. Since none matched the facing the street criteria we were given a non-smoking room and were told that this room was equipped with ashtrays as were all rooms in the hotel. We were kindly asked to smoke on the small balcony. We didnt as we chose to smoke outside the room as to not disturb other guests that would use the room after us but the policy of the hotel might be worth noticing if you are somehow sensible to the odor of tobacco.The room we booked was a standard room. We were not expecting something big and we got exactly that. The door opened directly to the bed room no corridor the bath room is located on the other end of the room. However it was comfortable enough to say the we spent two wonderful nights in this hotel. The bed was not too soft nor too hard: exactly as we wanted it to feel.After we were done with unpacking we took the elevator up to the hotel bar located on the ninth floor. Unfortunately it was not yet opened: the bar is available only from 3pm to 1am if we remember correctly. We managed to get back to the place when it was opened; the view is not as great as some suggested here because two many uninteresting buildings on the other side of the street however the free coffee you can choose either filter coffee of espresso; we chosed espresso and did not regret it and the nice weather managed to balance this inconvenient.One thing worth to note is that the booklet left inside the room indicates that you can get a free coffee from the room service at any hour of the day or night. This is a lie as we learnt by dialing the number shown on the document: the only way to have a coffee is to move to the hotel bar when it is open.Last but not least the breakfast was typical from a 3* or 4* hotel. For person you get a typical breakfast buffet. Worth to notice is that although you get your coffee from an automated coffee machine you can have either filter coffee or espresso. For the price you also have fresh orange juice; but you have no hot chocolate. If you plan to have breakfast at the hotel I recommend that you taste the kiwis: those that I eat there were from the most tasty and juicy that I experienced in the last few years.All in all this hotel is typically not the best hotel down town it is probably overrated in TripAdvisor unless ranking reflects the quality over price ratio. Although I can give you a list of better 3* or 4* hotels in the world the location and friendliness of the staff of the Best Western Atlantico makes it so that I would without hesitation recommend this hotel to anyone that is going to visit Madrid. In three days we could see a lot of sites do some shopping drink and eat without ever using the metro once. At booked through Expedia this is probably the best deal we could find here.
35-49,MALE,The best place to stay in Venice View from the room
65-XX,MALE,An excellent value without sacrificing We checked almost all of the hotel reviews for Mexico City on this and other sites and felt we could not ignore the enthusiam of others for such a modestly-priced hotel.The location is great the hotel was clean and the staff helpful. Even my reservation was there although the confirmation of it was not as clear as we wished.Our two night stay was flawless and the desk personnel happy to make reservations call cabs provide directions and maps and all ot the other things that make a visit nice.
35-49,FEMALE,Truly wonderful We cut our stay in Rome short due to the heat and called The Savoy on a whim to arrive the next day. I booked a room for my boyfriend and I and we were delighted to find that they had upgraded us to a suite with two balconies and the most amazing view Needless to say the service was perfect the entire time. From the front desk to the doorman and incredibly helpful concierge the service was impeccable. Everyone was genuinely friendly kind and efficient.The hotel itself feels new upscale and somewhat contemporary. Although the rooms are small they are tastefully furnished and the bathroom was marble tile and gorgeous. Our view and location was the most perfect we could have dreamed of. We will definitely be back and wouldnt imagine being in Florence in any other hotel.As an extra aside one day the concierge reserved a Mercedez with driver and guide. His name was Fabrizio and he took us to the Chianti region where we had lunch and wine tasting at a vineyard in the hills. Yes it was as perfect as it sounds.Thank you to the manager Simone and to the staff. The Savoy was our favorite hotel during our trip to Italy and France. And this review comes from a traveler who wouldnt stay at any less than a five star.
25-34,FEMALE,Good hotel in nice location We have just returned from NY had a confortable stay at Desmond Tutu Center. As other travellers have mentioned the hotel offers good value for money at current prices and it is conveniently placed for public transport only two stops away on the underground from Times Square. The area is very nice and safe and its a 10 minutes walk to the underground. The rooms vary in size we had a very small one while our friends had a much bigger room for the same rate. Ours resembled a big cupboard with only enough space to squeeze in past the bed and no lights on ceiling only two or three desk lamps which made it difficult to read in the evening. The bed is confortable nice linens and nice touches in room with tea/coffee machine available water toiletries in bath etc. I phoned the hotel direct to book and got a decent rate but then I noticed a much cheaper rate on the hotel website. I contacted the hotel by email and got the lower rate confirmed. There were also a few problems at check in we asked for a room away from the street 10th Avenue can be quite busy and the hotel is next to the road at which point the receptionist asked me if I wanted to cancel the reservation and go and find a better hotel very rude she was a supervisor as well After some convincing she agreed to transfer us to another room but then she made us wait for another hour before she dealt with the forms. After travelling for 12 hours this wasnt the welcome we expected but then the other staff were all nice and we had a good stay. Breakfast offers a good choice but no cooked food probably due to building regulations it includes smoked salmon boiled eggs bagels pastries a selection of fruit and fruit juices teas coffees etc. There is a nice choice of restaurants in the area we found two nice ones Don Giovanni down the street from the hotel 5 mins on 10th avenue makes fantastic pizza and offers a selection of other dishes and the Greek restaurant on corner of 9th avenue with 23rd street with a more modest decor but an excellent selection of nicely cooked meals at very decent prices.
25-34,MALE,Very good experience Pros: My wife and I stayed here during our visit to LA and had a very good time. The staff was friendly and helpful our room had as good a view as possible from a 4-story building but the best perk is the location. The proximity to the beach and nice eating places was really convenient the French cafe a block away was quite good. The complementary breakfast at the courtyard and Internet and the cheap parking $4 were also great. Cons: The room size was okay it was sunny and painted bright but the bath was small and cramped. Also the room rates we paid $200/night were a little high in my opinion given the amenities.Overall: Very positive experience but a little too expensive. Would definitely consider this next time were in west LA but would look around first for some other alternatives as well.
50-64,FEMALE,Excellent Hotel view from bedroom
50-64,FEMALE,Thanksgiving Week We stayed at the Hotel Residence Henri IV Two adults and our teenager [14]. It was a very nice size. ..two rooms small but still roomy by Paris standards..a little kitchenette with a microwave and refridgerator. The only thing missing was a coffee pot we bought a French Press and it solved the issue...The room was kept very clean..and we mostly had breakfast brought to our room which was juice coffee and pastry or bread..it was plenty for us..we arent big morning eaters.The area was quiet and we really had nothing to complain about. The staff were helpful and the trains were nearby.
25-34,MALE,Nice hotel We spent 55 euro for 2 people for 1 night on internet. The room was very spacious and cleanly. The position is near the city of Edam and Volendam. The breakfast wasnt included.
35-49,MALE,Wonderful Stay My wife and I stayed here on our honeymoon for 2 nights in early March and had a great stay.I had booked a room at another hotel on hotels.com on Jan. 6th though. Then 4 days before we were to start our honeymoon in San Fran. hotels.com send me an e-mail to say they had to change my reservation from a hotel downtown to a hotel at the airport. I rufused and was given a refund and no hotel. There was a huge 30000 person convention in town at the same time so all the hotels were full. I got lucky though and was able to book a bay view room at The Argonaut. This was the best thing that could of happened to us This place was amazing We arrived at the hotel around 12:30pm and were able to check in right away The staff were all so nice and called us by name whenever they saw us. The room was amazing We had a beautiful view of Alcatraz Island and could even see the golden gate. Internet worked great and the TV was fine. Its not a big fancy TV but we didnt fly all the way to San Fran. to watch TV anyway. What made our stay so great was the concierge. There was a wonderful young lady there that recommended 2 wonderful resturants for dinners and an amazing dim sum resturant for lunch. We enjoyed San Fran. way more then we ever thought we would and we owe that to The Argonaut Hotel and there staff. We cant wait to come visit again.
50-64,FEMALE,Not as good as expected Grounds from the lobby to our room
18-24,MALE,Great Hotel Great Staff....... Great City Booked a 6 night break at the Sofitel through their website after receiving my Sofitel privilege card we chose this hotel mainly because of the great reviews on this site and we were not disappointed. Right from the start all of the staff were very friendly and could not do enough to help you especially Randy the Doorman who would go out of his way to help you whenever he could.The room we had was a premier queen and whilst it the largest room in New York it was big enough very well equipped and very well decorated. Also has a medium sized bathroom which had a large shower but a small and shallow bathtub.The hotel is ideally located for exploring the city whether you want shopping on 5th Avenue Times Square or access to the subway system. I would highly recommend this hotel. If you are planning on staying here I suggest applying for a privilege card first as this gives you complimentary late check out and also 1 free drink per person from the bar.... Not to be sniffed at at hotel bar prices
50-64,MALE,Another great stay We stayed at the Carofftel Gobelins in 2006 for nine days and enjoyed it very much. This stay was only for three days but we found that everything was still the same. The owner/manager Christine Caroff is friendly and helpful. The rooms while not large are adequate and very clean; the location is good with Metro and bus links close by; and it is only a short walk in any direction to find good restaurants. The hotels breakfast is very good buffet style and the price is less than what you would pay outside the hotel. We have walked at a tourist pace from the hotel to the Eiffel Tower that covers most of the sights on the Left Bank in about an hour and a half. This hotel has everything that the traveller is looking for: clean rooms good food reasonable price great location and friendly staff. We hope to return to the Carofftel Gobelins again.
50-64,MALE,Thanks Gran Bahia Just got back from the Gran Bahia Principe in Punta Cana. We were part of a large wedding and we were part of the Club Golden package. With having read recent poor reviews of the Gran Bahia my wife and I thought we should come to the defense of this awesome resort. The rooms the grounds and the facilities are immaculate and clean. We were very pleased not only with the a la carte restaurants but the buffets as well. But above all the staff made our stay truly memorable. They were friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable. On our first day we found the safe was inoperable. A technician was at our room within 10 minutes of our phone call being placed and fixed it within minutes. Great service.While we were there we did see some folks upset about the smallest thing. The poor staff were shouted at and verbally abused. Please people relax you are not in your home country things may not go as well as things back home but your stay will be better if you relax.An example we overheard staff getting reamed out from the smell from the storm drainage area aka swamp. My gawd people you are in the tropics. RelaxOur favourite a la carte was the Mediterranean with a close 2nd the Brazilian.This is a very large resort so if you want quaint and private this is not the resort for you. On the other hand the size offers great restaurant selection many pools a large beach area and lots of choices.The Dominican people are wonderful friendly and obviously enjoy there work. Their pride shined thru
18-24,FEMALE,Jewel in Barcelonas Crown The view from our room was amazing
65-XX,FEMALE,Great hotel in great location Two short blocks from city center this lovely hotel is perfectly located. Large room with double sinks in full bath made for comfort and convenience. Included breakfast buffet was ample and delicious. Would definitely stay here again
50-64,MALE,Great Place Friendly Service Great Man
25-34,FEMALE,Amazing We stayed here for ten days in June 07 and loved every minute of it. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are the friendliest of people. We organised a day trip to Ubud with the hotel and received a tour guide and vehicle for the day for a very good price. This hotel is so close to a lovely part of the beach and the pool is superb. The breakfast has variety for everybody and the rooms are spacious and very clean. we stayed in a deluxe chalet which was set among beautiful gardens not far from the pool. we honestly couldnt fault this hotel it is just like paradise
50-64,FEMALE,Loved this experience Fantastic the location the building the roomsthe service. Top rate all the way. Expensive but worth every Euro cent.
18-24,MALE,Great little place GREAT little hotel Near ALL the major shopping and musums in Boston The staff was friendly the used-to-be moter inn and a certain charm about it as I was scared it would be low-budget and nasty. To my great surprise it was charming and great. Beds were comfortable and bathroom worked fine.
50-64,FEMALE,Perfect We stayed at the Renaissance Paris Vendome for 5 nights from April 20th-April 25 2007. We used our Marriott points and upgraded to a premier room for $60.00 per night extra.The hotel is in a perfect location. 2 blocks to the Louve 1 block to the Tuileries. The room was pleasant very clean and had windows that opened to the courtyard. The only drawback was that there is no bureau. We used the shelves but they are a bit shallow.The bath is lovely the shower small. I preferred to swim in the beautiful pool and shower in the locker room which is bigger and easier.We walked everywhere prob 12 miles each day. Breakfast taken daily at Le Pian sp? up two blocks and around the corner. Ther are multiple cafes and restaurands in the Marche area...all wonderful. First dinner was at Cafe Flotte. Fabulous...concierges Davied Julian and Olivier are top notch.Ah Paris our first trip...most beautiful city we have ever seen. A special night at Cafe LHomme with Paris friends...the Eiffle Tower is 1 block away..right in front of you and the light show begins on the hour at night. Eat on the open patio. I will never forget this fabulous sight nor will we ever forget Paris....
50-64,MALE,Good location good facilities not the best My sister and I stayed here over the Mardi Gras week-end. We stayed on a room and were given a room with a most stunning view over Hyde Park. The room was well furnished well maintained and had some great extras such as micro wave and toaster. The beds were very comfortable with pillow tops on the mattresses great nights sleep The bathroom had a huge tub and a great shower with lots of water pressure.The hotel is located next to the park close to the major shopping centres was ideal for Mardi Gras which runs down nearby Oxford Street. It has an amazing open air pool on the 23rd floor surrounded by glass walls giving great views across Sydney.Service did however leave a great deal to be desired The staff as naturally friendly as I have experienced elsewhere in Australia. A call to get an ice bucket and ice took 3 calls and still arrive before we left for the evening of apologies but just no desire to make things happen. are very busy this an excuse not a reasonProbably would stay here again but there are lots of great hotels in Sydney and for top end prices you do want the
25-34,MALE,Not too keen on the Sants I was staying on business attending a conference at the Fira. From that perspective the location of the hotel is good - within an easy 10-15 minute of Placa Espanya - so no reliance on taxis or public transport. From the tourists perspective the location isnt great as it isnt too near the majority of attractions. That said it is still pretty central and being right on top of Sants station makes for very easy access to the airport.In terms of decore the hotel is *very* tired my room having seen much wear and tear. Beds are cheap and hard not in a pleasantly firm way but with more of a cheap mattress with few springs vibe. My aircon worked thought that of many of my fellow guests didnt leading to perpetually freezing or baking rooms.There are many other hotels in Barcelona. I wouldnt recommend picking this one unless proximity to the Fira is your main criteria.
25-34,MALE,Great time at the Marriot Courtyard Ginza Lobby Lounge
65-XX,FEMALE,Elegant and comfortable We stayed in this lovely hotel July 12 - 16. It suited our travel needs more than adequately. The location is super. Surrounded by wonderful restaurants Grill 23 and Atlantic Fish to mention two. Our room on the 11th floor was a two double beds room. The room was more spacious than most other hotels where we paid a far higher rate. Beds were comfortable. One ding -- no choice of pillows all very large. Bathroom while not huge was certainly adequate and well planned. Lots of very nice towels and a great shower.The staff was top notch. Check in took minutes. The concierge service was excellent. The City Bar was beautiful and very popular with a nice crowd of people.I highly recommend The Lenox to anyone wanting to be treated like somebody while they are in Boston. We would happily stay there again.
35-49,MALE,Worst Hotel Experience Ever My wife and I were mislead into thinking that Waikiki was a little city. Dont be fooled Waikiki is a BIG city The images mainlanders have of Hawaii are that of palm trees blowing gently in the breezes this is not it I live in the Los Angeles area and it felt way too close to home. My wife and I couldnt wait to leave Waikiki. As for Ohana East. I was given a room on the first floor eye level with the bus stop/hooker hangout. Yep I said hooker hangout. I requested another room and was told by the staff that there were no other rooms available. And as for the buses they run pretty regularly. Through most of the night. About 20 feet from the sliding glass door. It was aweful. My wife and I contacted Pleasant Holidays whom we have used a half dozen times before and they got us over to Kaui where the pace was just what we had hoped for. Relaxed. Point being if you live in a city and are flying anywhere from 5-10 hours to get away from the hustle and bustle go to Maui away from Lahaina or for a rural really slow paced vacation head over to Kaui. Good times friends.
65-XX,MALE,great value Fantastic value. Perfect location. We got a special via Travelocity at only $85 USD per night with $25 Canadian parking and it was truely a treat.The rooms are small in fact very small as are the bathrooms but are well furnished. The kitchen wont prepare anything unless you can cook with a microwave but the fridge was large for a mini.King size beds and very comfortable. Quiet in all respects.The higher the floor the larger the room and the better the view. Ours was the 13th and it barely could see the lake. It goes up to over 40.Dont bring a car if you can avoid it. The limo service is free but requires an advance reservation not always available. The subway is just next door and goes about wherever most tourist sites are.Grocery stores are nearby and fairly cheap. Go northeast not south or west.The lobby and bar are great. Free newspaper.Highly recommended especially if you get a prepaid deal as we did.
65-XX,FEMALE,Great to stay with the Stars Location so close to Union Square was magic. The rooms are small very functional with cutting edge decor which we enjoyed. The down side was that they tended to be a bit noisey. Staff were helpful and the rooms very clean the beds were also very comfortable. We would stay here again for the location and as we were tourists and did not want the facilites of a 5 star hotel i.e. gyms and resturants we were happy with the cost saving. The ability to be able to walk anywhere was such a bonus we would be happy to stay here again. The high speed internet really worked in our room.
65-XX,MALE,great location we had a great room here staff very frendley and helpfull good location #30 bus 1 block from hotel takes you most places down town
35-49,FEMALE,Very impressed with Country Inn Our church brought more than 100 volunteers to New Orleans in June 2007 and took a large block of rooms at CIS including their large meeting room. The staff and management were unfailingly friendly and helpful -- from the valets to the front desk to the management. They even opened the breakfast room early to accomodate our schedule. Everything was very clean and seemed new. There is a bit of room for improvement in the timing of the room cleaning which was sometimes rather late in the day. Yes the pool is small but our pre-teens enjoyed it none-the-less. We also appreciated the self-service washer and dryer $1.25/load each and free WiFi. The location felt safe and was convenient to the French Quarter and several good CBD restaurants Mothers Bon Ton Cuvee all within a couple of blocks. Country Inn Suites far exceeded my expectations for a hotel at this price point.
25-34,FEMALE,Fantastic we stayed for 2 weeks and had a fantastic time everything is to a high standard. The food in all the restaurants is very very good and there is something for everyone to eat. The beach is beautiful and the sea is like a warm bath you can do as much or as little as you fancy the staff are fantastic what more can I say but GO My favorite hotel in the DR by far.
35-49,FEMALE,Great Time at Dreams POunta Cana My daughter and I stayed at Dreams Punta Cana from June 28 - July 4 2008. Our accomodations were in the Preferred Club building 6. The resort is beautiful and well maintained but what makes this resort stand apart from the rest is the staff in the Preferred Club section building 6. The Preferred Club staff is by far the best that I have encountered at any resort and I travel frequently. Check in with Ricardo Narvo was quick and easy and we were in our room in minutes. The rooms are spacious clean and well appointed even the bed was comfortable. Daily; Vanessa Disla Jorge Polanco Yan Le Guillou Magalis Rodriguez George and Bertilio greeted us with bright smiles and a cheerful hola and provided us with any assistance that we needed. Although the entire staff is great it is Vanessa Disla that stands out as the best Vanessa consistently provided us with attentive service and went out of her way to assure that our vacation was special and memorable - which it was Vanessa made sure we enjoyed every aspect of our vacation - and even had a plate of chocolates delivered to our room one night and on the last night had a plate of confections delivered to the room with Have a nice trip written in chocolate on the plate. Vanessa provided us with the best service that I have ever experienced at a resort. And - I must add that George and Bertilio are the best bar tenders in Punta Cana.In addition because we are repeat guests of Dreams Resorts first time at Punta Cana we were treated to a special dinner at the El Patio restaurant which was wonderful and made us feel extra special.If you go to this resort the Preferred Club is the way to go The Preferred Club has a private lobby which provides use of free internet service DVDs available for use at no charge pool/beach towels available without the towel card continental breakfast and afternoon snacks and a private bar. There is also a private section of the beach for preferred club members that has fabulous beach beds along with great lounge chairs and thatched huts for shade. There is wait service on the beach. But the biggest reason to stay in the Preferred Club - is that you get the best staff on the island to assist you with your vacation needs and questions.The resort and grounds are well maintained and beautiful. The pool is fantastic and you will want to stay in for hours. The beach is nice there are a lot of rocks in the water that you need to watch out for but the sand is soft breeze delightful and it is a quiet place to relax and unwind.The restauranbts and food are good. A la carte restaurants and no reservations required there is also a buffet restaurant if you prefer. The spa and spa services are also very good - I would recommend the hot stone massage. The jacuzzi hydro massage and showers are great in the spas wellness center.Overall the resort is a great place to go. You have the choice of either R R or lots of activities with the entertainment staff. There is always an activity going on whether it is volly ball aerobics water polo dance lessons ping pong comnpetitions or crazy games such as water balloon fights. The Core Zone is great for all ages with pool tables air hockey fooz ball archery and even mechanical bull riding.The only downfall is the air conditioning system - so if you do not like it hot - do not go in July - go during cooler months. The air conditioning in the rooms did not work well but the ceiling fans allowed you to sleep in comfort.I would definitely recommend this resort - but stay in the Preferred Club section and let Vanessa Jorge Yan Magalis Ricardo George and Bertilio spoil you They will make you feel like royalty during your stay.
50-64,MALE,Bad first impression. My partner had secretly arranged with the staff to have a bottle of champagne champagne glasses that were sent over from Bloomingdales and two tuxs to be in the room when we arrived. He even told them what time we were to arrive. Upon check in we were told our room might be ready and I told them thats ok we can check our bags walk around and come back later. Instead we were sent up to our room. This was simple...the front desk could have stalled by asking us to have a seat in the bar but didnt. We got to our room it wasnt 30 seconds when the champagne arrived. The glasses tuxs arrived some time later...seperatly... mind you they had been sitting downstairs at the concierge all morning. We were given a verbal appology by the manager but you cant undo something like that and expect it to be enough. They could have comped the champagne but we didnt pursue it. I had high hopes for this property by reading all of the postings but the hotel blew it for me big time.
35-49,MALE,Great Choice Stayed here on a Friday night. Had a week long conference downtown and a flight out Saturday morning. Very busy hotel several banquets etc. The hotel has two parking options valet for $20 with unlimited in/out priveleges and free self parking in a garage 50 yard walk from the entrance. Staff was excellent from the valet bellman to check in very smooth; waitstaff at dinner and breakfast was very professional. Hotel has five dining choices for dinner: room service a steakhouse sports bar southwestern restaurant and a 24 cafe. All seemed to be good choices. My room was on 13th floor had view of runway and balcony. Flat screen TV and Granite and Marble shower were very nice. The bed was excellent as well. I think I was in a suite but for some reason I think all the rooms are large after the renovation. Breakfast buffet is better than average. $15 per person but well worth it. Fitness center is open 24/7 but leaves much to be desired. At least it was free. Internet is $10 per day. Pictures on hotels website are accurate. Nice Place very convenient if using the airport. Probably to much of a hassle for anything outside of the airport complex.
65-XX,MALE,Perfect for a visit to Madrid We really enjoyed our three night stay at the Mario. The rooms are small but adequate and like the rest of the hotel spotlessly clean. For us the best points were the central location in a quiet street the excellent breakfast and the friendly staff.Our room was at the back of the hotel with a tiny window and no views but the compensation was the quietness apart from some inconsiderate corridor noise. We had no problems with the bathroom which actually had a very welcome bath in it.Our favourite place to eat was the Museo del Jamon in Calle Mayor where you can stand at the counter with the crowd of locals and have a drink and a sandwich or eat a hot meal upstairs in the equally packed cafeteria. Great atmosphere and reasonable prices.For a full restaurant meal try La Vaquita Argentina tucked in a corner of the Opera square - especially good for carnivores.If you fancy a change from standard Spanish beer Naturbier in Plaza Santa Ana brew their own German style cloudy lager. Ask for a tostada and you will get a dark version. Very tasty.The Tourist Office in Plaza Mayor do a selection of guided walks in English lasting about an hour for around 4 Euros. We did a couple and found them very good value.Room Mate Mario is a great hotel - book it now.
50-64,MALE,Great service We stayed at this hotel to mark a special occasion. We arrived early but the room was available. We were pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to a junior suite. The service provided at the desk was wonderful and this was followed up with a gift in the room.The hotel is older than some but has been beautifully decorated and has a warm comfortable feel.Location is very central for both business and pleasure travellers.All in all we could not fault the hotel or the wonderful service.
35-49,MALE,Amazing Personal service amazing location great rooms. I travel 40-60 days per year. Always on a expense account. Always for buisness. I usually only stay at Westins if I can.Great service matters. Quiet clean rooms matter. Nice beds and quietness matters.If all of this matters to you then 41 Hotel is the right place for you.I had a wonderfull 3 day stay. They have complimentary food around the clock available. Honor bar in lounge and staff to attend your every need. Free internet.More like staying at a good friends house.I will be back when I return to London.
25-34,FEMALE,Great Location some issues.... Booked two rooms at govt rate. Booked for 19-22 although we were arriving from Korea on the 20th to ensure a room at 0700 on the 20th.Arrived and I had no room. They then said I could get a room but Id have to move at noon. I thought this was unacceptable since I had paid for a room beginning the night before. I asked for an upgraded room if I had to move. I was then magically given a room. I figured it would be bottom of the barrel and I was right. It was in the Diamond tower which I think it one of the oldest. It was bare bones but decent.The location ammentities and shops were great I used the Mandara Spa pool and gym. Pricey but nice.Checkout was insane. There were so many ppl standing there and the system was down. Not effecient at all.Would probably try this place again not too sure.
50-64,FEMALE,Excellent choice Great location The hotel is cozy and quaint. Our room was very nice clean and well maintained. The breakfast was a nice variety and beautifully served. The location is amazing. Two blocks to the Duomo a few blocks to the Uffizi and Pontevecchio. We walked everywhere didnt need a taxi. Florence was very clean and wonderful although quite expensive.Would highly recommend the Calzaiuoli and would stay there next visit. I am a travel agent and will include it in my list for my clients.
35-49,MALE,Cest fantastique This is the way Trip Advisor is supposed to work. My wife and I were looking for a good deal at a smaller hotel so we pulled up TA and at the time the Magda was #1 or #2 and it had a number of glowing reviews. We took other travelers advice and it was exactly what we expected. Yohann and the others at the front desk was extremely helpful and made some outstanding recommendations for dinners and nightlife. If you are like us and would rather spend more money on actiivties and great meals than you would on the hotel but still need a clean safe place to sleep this hotel is perfect.
35-49,FEMALE,Great Hotel - Great Location After many nights researching hotels for this trip I decided on the Intercontinental Mark Hopkins. We were so glad we ended up at the Mark Hopkins. Great location beautiful hotel in Nob Hill. ROOMBooked the Excutive Level King - Room 1422. This room had a grea view of the Golden Gate Bridge/Bay Grace Cathedral and California Cable Line. Ask for this room.It is an older hotel like many in San Francisco but well-maintained and nicely decorated. We didnt find the room to be any smaller than a normal hotel weve stayed in during our travels.CLUB LEVEL A MUSTMake sure you book a Club Level room. Its well worth the extra cost in snack and drinks alone. Its a very nice lounge that serves 5 mini-meals throughout the day starting at 6:30-10:30 I believe. Great for grabbing breakfast snack or tea in the afternoon lite appetizers and drinks in the evening. Especially nice if traveling from east coast and havent adjusted to time difference. I went down and read a few mornings so not to disturb others.Nancy at the Concierge Desk is very informative and can answer any questions you may have. She was my morning friend each dayTOP OF THE MARKThe views are great Dress up and go on up for a drink and danceIf you book through the website or hotel directly check back to see if rates drop. We booked and found a reduced rate a few days prior to leaving and hotel matched price. Also check if your company has corporate rates. I was able to get a great price and worth it to stay here.WARNING: PRINT RESERVATIONS WITH RATESMake sure you print out your reservation including rates. My only gripe is after calling and speaking directly to a reservationist my new rate was not reflected in the system. Had I not brought along my new confirmation I had been charged the higher price. Even after presenting email confirmation I was second guessed by Front Desk. Not at all how you want to start your trip after traveling several hours. Note to Front Desk staff you are the first impression to your guest. Only gripe about entire tripI highly recommend getting the City Pass Citypass.com with the California and Powell Cable Cars running literally in front of the hotel it makes getting to any place in city a breeze. It includes unlimited cable cars $5 one-way and muni buses for $57 for a 7-day pass and includes admissions to attractions and museums. If you got time also check out Mr. Toads Tours. Sounds corny and 100% touristy but who cares it was well worth the moneyTadishs on California Street worth the wait.If your there over a weekend a must is the Farmers Market at the end of California Street - Take the Cable Car down the hill quick walk to water.
65-XX,MALE,pleasant stay at JW Marriott I am very tardy in recording this experience which occured in late March of this year. The hotel is well-placed for getting around in the city by any means and we felt quite comfortable in the Union Square area. The corner room near the top of the hotel was superb as was the housekeeping staff. Despite construction being present the staff made efforts to not allow it to be an impediment to our 5 day stay. The consierge staff was mistaken on their suggestions/ directions a few times and provided out-dated information. At this hotel we were very near excellent restaurants shopping and transportation within blocks of the hotel. American Airlines lived up to its reputation for tarnishing an otherwise enjoyable vacation in a beautiful hotel with a great staff.
25-34,MALE,Good hotel Good hotel on a good location. Very close to Place de CataluniaStayed here for 3 days with the company I work for and would definitely go back next time..Reason why the hotel doesnt get 5 stars is because of the bar personel. The guy behind the bar was not friendly quite rude even. Prices are quite high as well...Should you go to Barca I would definitely recommend Club Opium in Barceloneta Great Spot to have dinner and to go clubbing afterwards
25-34,FEMALE,Hands down it was our best and favorite vacation Neither my husband nor I had anything to worry about and neither should you I am truly saddened by those who felt they had such poor customer service because we felt quite pampered... :-Our stay was July 19 - 26 and was it ever HOT Never a cloud in the sky the entire week. We love hot so we didnt mind but were glad we brought plenty of sunscreen we almost used up 3 bottles between the two of us... I must say that we had the most amazing vacation at the Majestic and will ABSOLUTELY be back next year We are already planning a two week stay with extended family. Our room was perfect if you can get 2250 you will love it. Great view of the pool and the ocean as well cant go wrong with that We could never hear anything outside of the patio doors once they were closed. And we were right across the beach restaurant so that says a lot. The room was immaculate the maids did an excellent job. The mini fridge was always well stocked. We left a note asking for more water on the first day and every single day after that we must have had 6 bottles waiting for us plus pop The pool is like none other I have ever seen. Its the full length of the resort and was NEVER crowded. You could probably put everyone who stayed at the resort in the pool and you wouldnt touch each other. So that really eased up the beach as well. The beach was never crowded either. We walked up and down the beach quite a bit and found that the other resorts beachfronts were much more jammed with people. My husband and I really couldnt care less where we were beach pool whatever everywhere you looked was an amazing view. Which takes me to the grounds. The staff works VERY hard at keeping the grounds well manicured. My husband ran each morning around the perimeter of the resort usually around 6:30/7:00 and would see all the workers dropped off ready to start the day. There was one morning they were spraying the bushes for bugs/mosquitos we never had a mosquito bite the entire trip. At that time of the morning they are cleaning having staff meetings at the restaurants all making sure we all would have the best vacation possible. I am so appreciative of their hard work ethic most of them were there from sunrise to way after sunset. So to tell me the service was bad sorry. I didnt see it.There were so many options for meals we couldnt possibly get to everywhere we wanted to try. Breakfast was incredible. Tons of food to choose from I really cant think of anything they didnt have. Lunch we always went to the beach buffet. Every day was amazing view of the ocean while we ate we didnt want to go anywhere else Never had an issue with any of the food there. There is a lot I cant eat due to allergies but I ALWAYS found something. Dinner you must make a reservation for the Japanese Restaurant Matsuri. I could never eat half of what they gave theres that much food I wanted to finish it because it was the best food there the shrimp is to die for but couldnt stuff it all in I liked the french gourmet restaurant the chicken was very good. The seafood and steak restaurants were not bad but werent our favorite either. I chose food at the buffets that were cooked in front of you for the most part. That way I ensured the temperature was good and the food wasnt out for too long.Were not the ones to ask about nightlife. We are up so early in the morning that we were too exausted by the time the shows were starting. So we never made it to any. But after dinner there was always two guys playing just outside of the main buffet in an open air stage area one on keyboard and one on either an alto or soprano sax. The last night we were there they had a full band with three singer performing what I think were very popular latin songs. They were fantasticIm sure Im leaving a million things out but I will say this. I LOVED this resort. We have never come home so rested and relaxed it could not have been a better vacation. BIG thank you-s to AnneMarie for always providing fabulous service and for being there for any questions. I am so sad I didnt get to meet you To Victor at the front desk who was very accomodating and made sure we were happy. To Oscar at Matsuri who provided great entertainment and fabulous food I really wish we could have taken you home And lastly to Victor at the pool bar YEAH BABAY He made every visit to the bar a great one we looked forward to seeing him every day. The man LOVES his job If anyone has any questions at all please feel free to private message me. I will do my best to help. I seriously cant stop talking about the Majestic I might as well be of some use to all of you Im still mourning the fact that I have to cook for myself and CLEAN... just terrible... :-
65-XX,MALE,Puzzled Usually we read up on hotels before we book. This time we got a very late deal and did it backwards. The negativity of some reviews made us very apprehensive -but -Only just got back on line since we returned. This is the first time we have posted on Trip Advisor becauseeven if we disagree we can usually see where people are coming from. Not here though.Sunbeds on the beach. Some naughtiness in booking late at night. My wife joined a get up and see the sunrise ad hoc group. If people are that keen so be it. Perhaps the hotel could manage the situation a little better.The shows we never saw. 10pm is very late when you get up before dawn.Ann has mobility problems but we were given a groundfloor room close to the beach and we didnt find getting around much of a problem. Our room we rated up to standard for the area our 15th holiday this way in recent years.We rated the buffet excellent for all three meals even made a point of complimenting the Chef. Only been impressed enough to do that on one previous occasion. Drinks with meals and service never a problem.The beach buffet was the best we have come across yet. We discovered this on day three and lunched there for the rest of the fortnight.We enjoyed all the speciality restaurants especially the Oriental. The Steakhouse I suspect should be called the Grill. Give it a miss if you like big portions. We rated it a pleasant change.Almost throughout we found the service to be excellent. Having read some complaints on this we started to look for evidence. Found none. I spent some time at all of the bars as one does on holiday. Impressed with how all of the bartenders tried to serve guests in order and remain cheerful and polite.On the last night we had a disturbing problem. We thought it a pity that the hotel should let itself down at the 11th hour so on the following morning we informed the management of our concerns. In the couple of hours it took us to pack the incident was investigated and comprhensive explanation was given - including steps the hotel had taken to prevent a recurrence. Very impressed.We like to try new hotels. Have only done repeats to one in this area before but we will be looking to return to this one.
25-34,FEMALE,Gorgeous Hotel Gorgeous Hotel. Spacious 1 Bedroom Suite All to myself Was traveling for Business during Grammy Week. So many people were in town. Definately a great time to Be in LA. Will definately go back. Rooms are very clean and house keeping is very attentive. Food is a bit pricey but decent. Shopping is nearby. Concierge was very helpful in providing me with a map to Rodeo Drive. Had a great time. Will definately go back and bring my husband with me this time
35-49,MALE,Soulless We were looking forward to staying here based on the hotel website and pictures displayed there. We booked a superior room and would recommend doing so based on some of the previous reviews. Our room was fairly large and came with stylish lighting and decorated with a modern theme. Breakfast was good with a large selection although the layout of the table can mean that this can be an impersonal affair. The location of the hotel is ok and a easy walk along the river takes you to the Ponte Vecchio and all of the Florence sites.The staff were not great and one day we arrived back at 3.30pm to find the room had not been serviced however a quick call to reception fixed this. Overall a nicely decorated hotle but let down by the staff and lack of character to the place.
18-24,FEMALE,A good hotel let down by bad service... We stayed at Sheraton on the Park for three nights in a city view king room on the 11th floor the room was large and spacious newly renovated and had a marble bathroom with a separate bath and shower.The hotel is in a great location its close to major shopping areas and multiple forms of public transport and the executive lounge is fantastic. The lobby decor is nice and the bar/dining options were good.However the service wasnt that amazing it took 25 minutes to get our car out of valet on one occasion and 15 minutes on another. The bell boy took so long to come collect our bags when we checked out we ended up just struggling with them ourselves. The staff were neither rude or nice just average.The room was very noisy we could hear the rooms around us and everything going on in the hallway. My parents were also staying at the hotel on a different floor and they also had the same noise problems.In the room we stayed in we had shutters instead of curtains these didnt block out enough light in the morning and had large cracks where they joined each other so the room wasnt very dark in the mornings. If I stayed here again Id definitely be requesting a room with curtains.Overall my experience at this hotel was a good one I would stay at this hotel again if I got a good rate I was just disappointed a 5 star hotel would have poor service.
50-64,MALE,Its gotten cheaper -- in more ways than one This was the seventh of the last eight Christmases at the Hilton Hawaiian Villages upscale Alii Tower. It was more economical but the service plain and simply wasnt what it has been in previous years.The room itself was fine and scenic. I asked in advance for an upgrade to Ocean View Alii from Partial Ocean View Alii and it was waiting on arrival. Also asked for a quiet room and it was that too. Room itself was fine and the view of the Pacific from the 12th Floor for a retireee rate of $269 a night plus tax including free hors doerves poolside each night and with my Hilton Gold membership free continental breakfast was in my opinion a good bargain. Also got a complimentary fresh fruit amenity plate on arrival.The price had dropped twice since I booked it in March -- Hilton didnt tell me this but when I saw it on their website I rebooked it each time. Considering the category -- Ocean View Honolulu Beach Resort at Christmas -- I have no complaints about price.So whats the problem?Mainly housekeeping and service. Specifically little things that were omitted. When you read this list it will seem petty but remember the Alii Tower is supposed to be the upscale tower of the Hilton Alii means elite in Hawaiian. Earlier this decade they used to have a fancy-white-uniform doorman at the tower door and they serviced rooms three times daily that was overkill I admit -- even a bother-- but it shows how seriously they USED to take service. But now no doorman once-a-day housekeeping and my gripes: *No laundry/dry clean bags in the holder provided for them. *No ice bag liners for the ice buckets two nights out of five. *TV remote that wouldnt work and when I called Guest Service Hotline rang so long it went to a recording. Finally got a human to take the TV trouble call but then no one showed up and I had to call again. *Forgot to leave regular coffee packets the last day only decaf.*Hilton bedside chocolates only one night out of five.*Poolside continental breakfast had now gone over $20 for those who werent Gold members the fresh-produce quality seemed to have declined and they had switched to disposable plates and dishes and plastic utensils.Is it still a decent hotel? Yes.Is it a good bargain? It certainly can be if you book carefully and keep checking back. Sure was for me.Is it the luxury deluxe tower it used to be? Absolutely not.
25-34,FEMALE,Loved the hotel The rooms are clean and up to date I have stayed here several times and keep coming back because the price is good and the rooms are just great
25-34,MALE,Great Hotel Superb Location Swiss Dutch flags mark hotel cash machine on corner
65-XX,FEMALE,Warning to Travelers We stayed at this resort from Feb. 22 2007 until March 1 2007. I agree with a lot of what others have said about the resort.The meals were ho-hum; we loved the beach but hated the fact that we had to rise before dawn to secure 8 lounges togetherunder a palapa; the weather was wonderful; the ocean was clear; the room was great as was the maid service.My one huge complaint is that when my brother back in the states contracted viral encephalitis and my sister-in-law tried to reach me the resort did not get the message to me. My daughter called the 2nd day was promised by someone at the front desk that they would get the message to me. It never happen Finally on the 3rd day my daughter happened to call while I was in the room and told me what happened. Thank God that he was out of the woods by the time she called. He was still in guarded condition so I wanted to speak to him my sister-in-law to assure myself that he was going to be OK. I tried to call from the room but was unable to do so. We went to the front desk to complain and were offered no help regarding the phone other than we could go buy a phone card. The man said he was sorry his sorry didnt sound very sincere but did not respond as one would have hoped in such an emergency situation. The icing on the cake happened on the last day. We were going through all the literature regarding the resort; the blank stationery they leave for your use on the coffee table; etc. In the folder with the stationery was an unmarked envelope with the fax my sister-in-law sent me on the 1st day.
35-49,FEMALE,***** Star Service SO much has been said about this property already but I am happy to report The Hotel Vitale is my new found fave in San Francisco. Im usually a creature of habit but decided to give Hotel Vitale a try. I always love walking along the water visiting the Ferry Building and Farmers Market Dining Shopping Exploring-and this property makes a great base to experience the best of San Francisco. The service was incredible from the moment I arrived. I felt genuinely welcomed by the Valet Bell staff Front Desk etc. The Concierges are outstanding and every recommendation was spot on. The Vitale attracts a nice diverse all ages mix of people singles families couples and is such a comfortable place to stay and relax. I was truly surprised at the quality of staff quality of food and water view/s at reasonable prices. The Vitale has a cozy Lounge and stylish Restaurant offering some truly delectable food and delightful service and let us not forget about the simple comfortable rooms complete with every amenity.
35-49,FEMALE,Better than I Expected But Theres Room for Improvement I stayed at the Caribe Hilton from May 5th - May 8th. I liked a lot of things about the hotel the open-air lobby the Starbucks the cleanliness of the rooms and the tropical garden but there were a few issues:1 There was no one at the check-in desk when I arrived. If you were Hilton Honors or a VIP your line was staffed but there was no one there for normal check-ins. Not the best first impression.2 Room service trays and garbage were not picked up promptly from the hallways. When my next door neighbor had dinner his tray of half-eaten food remained outside the room until lunchtime the next day. This happened more than once.3 Beach service was spotty. One day there was someone taking orders but the next day there was no one to be seen. I dont mind getting up to get my drinks and food but sometimes you just want to veg out and not move.4 Food and drink prices are extraordinarily high. $10 for a Bud Light Thats ridiculous. 5 There needs to be a higher level of attentiveness to guests from some of the staff. One evening when I tried to get a cab to take me to the casino at the El San Juan Hotel it took 5 minutes of standing around before the staff stopped chatting with each other to ask if they could help. All in all I had a great trip because the weather in PR was wonderful and the beach at the hotel was really all I needed for a relaxing stay. Would I stay here again? Maybe if I found a really great rate but it wouldnt be my first choice.
25-34,FEMALE,good hotel for a citybreak My husband and I spend 4 nights in this hotel. I had emailed the hotel in front to ask for a room on one of the higest floors and they did their best to take this request into account. We had a room on the 9th floor and could enjoy from a lovely view on Barcelona.The Hotel is located in a quiet area and the tube is nearby. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by staff at reception with a glass of champagne. Check in was nice quick.Breakfast was included in our room price and what a breakfast. So much choice including cavaWe used the Wellness centre once- really relaxingWould definately book this hotel again.
50-64,FEMALE,The only thing I hated about EdenH...... ...was LEAVING it Oh my gosh we had such a good time at EdenH last week Aug 3-10 that I had the sad face on during ride back to the airport. I think the resort grounds are picturesque rooms are clean and modern as is the entire property. We requested a 4th floor room and never took elevators gotta burn those calories any way we canPools are really pretty and the beach is great. Plenty of chairs for all. The shows were typical of AI resorts. The food was good we ate at ala cartes 3X--Italian once and American twice--couldve easily booked more but wanted to eat at buffet a few times and Friday night is Beach Party Drinks are yummy and fattening. Note to all rum cream lovers in Jamaica....they have Barcelo Cream here..VERY similar to rum cream...delicious The bars are cool especially lobby bar Alisios sp? Tons of top shelf booze and smiling bartenders that will make you any drink you ask for. We didnt do any excursions but did take a parasail--a must I dare anyone to experience this and not love itAnother thing I liked about this resort was the staff. Check in...bartenders...housekeeping...wait staff....groundskeepers...ALL were smiling and helpful. I hadnt been to Punta Cana in 4 years and it reminded me of how much I like the people of the DR thats Ive come in contact with.I read the negative reviews of EH and once again have to ask myself...were we at the same place?? I suppose it didnt hurt that we had a solid week of hot sunny days never saw one mosquito and dont care about wash cloths ha haIf youre heading to EdenH and are concerned my humble opinion is....DONT BE. Take your smile your good attitude and your camera and prepare for vacation bliss. EnjoyAdios fellow travelers
65-XX,MALE,Very nice hotel Stayed for three nights 14-17th. Booked on package with Eurostar their move to St Pancras. For anyone coming up from the South of England its a pain. Beautiful building but not a patch on Waterloo for ease of use. A most user unfriendly place with lousy sign-age. Thank goodness the staff are obliging.Anyway back to the hotel. Excellent location in the centre of the Opera district of Paris. However taxi driver didnt know where it was. After many about turns and reversing after going down a one way street the wrong way he found it. Not in the same league as London cabbies.Very welcoming and helpful English speaking staff. Size of room was average with fair sized wardrobe with built-in safe. Good sized dressing table with drawers for storage. Very comfortable bed but only one armchair. Good range of international programmes on TV with speaker in bathroom.Very clean and well appointed bathroom with bath with fixed and hand held shower overhead. Good range of toiletries. Towels and sheets changed daily.Heating only by air conditioning unit. Very quiet but if fan turned off no heating. But with outdoor temperatures at around c rooms held heat well except for our friends on the top 6th floor. No kettle or welcome tray but 24hr room service for light meals and snacks. The included continental breakfast arrangement was very nice with a good range of food to choose from.The only problem was a horrible smell on entering our room on the fifth floor. It was either the drains or the air-con. Not bad enough to spoil our stay but would have asked for a change of room had we stayed any longer. To be fair Paris can be a pretty smelly place anyway. I often wondered why Parisians are so keen on smoking fowl smelling cigarettes and eating so much garlic. It covers a multitude of sins.
65-XX,FEMALE,Friendly Hotel in Florence The Silla is a lovely place to stay in Florence. The staff is the most friendly and helpful of any hotel I have stayed in anywhere seriously. The rooms are large enough and have all the conveniences needed. Our daughter accompanied us on this trip and they arranged for her to have a room right next to ours with a view of the patio and the River. For Florence it is also a great value with rates that are less than other hotels of equal or lesser value. There is also a small grocery store just down the block in case you need anything or feel like eating in. It is away from the noisey and touristy center of Florence but close enough to walk anywhere of interest. Also cabs are fairly reasonably priced should you tire of walking. All things considered a great place to stay in Florence.
65-XX,MALE,Terrific Value The Excelsior isnt fancy but has a lot going for it. It is accross the street from the main train station in Frankfurt and has great breakfasts. The staff was pleasant and gave us a break by letting us into our room well before check-in. The rooms were clean and the price was affordable.
35-49,FEMALE,Good location-great beds we got a great deal through Hotwire for Texas/ou weekend. the hotel is in a great location-only a few blocks from West End and Victory Park. The lobby was very nice with a relaxing atmosphere in the bar area. we didnt use the pool but we had a great view of it from our room and it looked nice. The bed was one of the best i have ever slept in. The only downside was parking was $21. that is a bit steep in my opinion. I would stay there again if i needed a downtown hotel.
25-34,MALE,Loved the rooms and hospitality I had read great reviews on Harbour Plaza HK and thats why I decided to stay here. And I have to say I was not dissapointed.The Hotel has a great location in Hong Hum area 5 mins from Kowloon Bay which is like a centre for most of the activities in HP HK has one of the best views of HK frm the lobby itself. Wait till you check in to your rooms. I was living there with my family for 2 days and all of us had a good time.The restaurants are quite expensive and if with family u can always eat out. Nevertheless there are plenty of shops outsid ein the market and convenience stores so eating out is never a problem.The conceirge was particularly very helpful in telling us directions and modes of travel etc.The Door people happened to be of my nationality hence finding special cuisine restaurants and places to shop was very convenient.All in all we had a great time and would love to stay at HP next time we are in HK.
25-34,MALE,Perfect location We stay 3 nights at la residenza. Rooms are very clean. The owner of the hotel was a nice old lady. Her son luciano was also nice and helpful. We feel us like at home. The hotel is in the centre of firenze. Very close to restaurants city center and nice stores. Prada is across the street cartier is under the hotel all famous brands are in the same street I ll definitely stay in this hotel in my next trip.
25-34,FEMALE,Fantastic Customer Service We chose the Banks Mansion because we wanted a more comfortable hotel located close to our friends in Amsterdam. It definitely met this criteria and went way beyondThe fantastic customer service made the stay. They never hassled or even commented about our early check-in time. Our room was clean and fitted nicely with modern furnishings and extras like free mini bar and spirits in glass decanters. The bathroom was very nice with a shower and a really long bathtub Overall we enjoyed our stay.
65-XX,MALE,Excellent Mont Blanc Great location. Literally 5 mins  I timed it from Placa Catalunya and the Aerobus terminal outside El Corte Ingles. Good sized room at rear - nice and quiet . Good sized bathroom and plenty of storage space all spotlessly clean. Breakfast is an extensive cold buffet and dinner is based on a daily menu and a rather limited seasonal menu. We had dinner twice and found it to be excellent.Breakfast is 7 to 11 a.m. -very civilised   .as is the 12 noon checkout. There is secure luggage storage for late departures. All the staff were friendly and helpful from reception to porters. We would definitely use the Mont blanc again.
25-34,MALE,Great start to our honeymoon This place is great. We stayed here for the first week of our honeymoon and couldnt have asked for anything more. The staff even gave us a bottle of champagne to help celebrateWe got a corner room with a sofa in and a huge bed. It was very clean and tidy as was the bathroom - although it seems most American hotels have tiny baths in themThe Cortez restaurant downstairs is of an exceptional standard and we had some very pleasant meals there - followed by some equally pleasant cocktails.The hotel is situated extremely close to Union Square so is really handy for the shops and for the cable cars on Powell Street that will take you all the way up to Fishermans Wharf. Having read some reviews for this hotel on Tripadvisor and other sites I was initally worried about its close proximity to the Tenderloin with its slightly dodgy reputation but there was really nothing to worry about once we got there.As part of your stay at the Adagio youll get 15 minutes of free internet access either wirelessly or on one of the hotels business centre PCs.If you do stay here make sure you make the effort to go to Dotties True Blue Cafe around the corner. AwesomeAll in all we had a great week at a great hotel and it was everything we could have hoped for.
50-64,MALE,Quick access from Terminal E After a 8 hour intercontinental flight its nice to have a clean comfortable hotel at hand.Hilton Logan airport is such a hotel.Quick sufficient check in.Upgraded room without asking as a Hilton Honors gold member.Pool/sauna/steamroom OK.Breakfast buffet average. Free transportation to subway was efficient. Pick up from subwaystation after request by telephone was quickly.Quit room no noise from planes.
65-XX,FEMALE,Phew lbertsons are a 3min drive away. Cant think of anything the supermarket didnt sell apart from proper baked beans but then you can never get them in the statesWe ate at The Keg both the steak the salmon was delicious. We also tried The Bamboo Club - a wide variety of asian dishes on offer. Did not eat at the JW but Roys looked superb.Veryvery hot the entire week but you know before you go so be prepared. Will not be returning - there are too many places out there still to visit but would recommend both the MCV Arizona.
65-XX,MALE,Average hotel at best. We arrived Thursday evening for a three night stay after a trip to Las Vegas and were greeted by more noise in the lobby than anything Las Vegas had to offer  The bar on the ground floor resembles an after match booze up and appeared to be patronised solely by non-resident young Bostonians. Friday and Saturday evenings were exactly the same and therefore there is nowhere in the hotel for residents to sit and have a quiet relaxing drink.We had an executive corner best view room on floor eight which was tiny even by US standards. The view on all sides was straight into occupied office buildings and the bathroom  shower room   had a clear view window which meant the blind had to be down whilst the bathroom was in use. The bathroom was large but poorly designed without a bath although more than adequate space existed.We breakfasted once at the hotel and the food and service was adequate but nothing special. Although the printed bill for breakfast said service was not included an additional rubber stamp in red highlighting this fact was stamped on top of the bill - how thoroughly naff We paid $565 per night to stay here which seems absolute top dollar and the booking was made on the hotels website.Whilst the location is good for walking around the shopping district the hotel staff were friendly and helpful the bed and bedding were extremely comfortable my wife and I find very little else to recommend the hotel and quite a few things as highlighted above to put you off and especially the bar noise which was quite absurd The real mystery to me having used Trip Advisor extensively in the past is how this hotel can possibly be the current number one recommended hotel in Boston on Trip Advisor.....Philip Hills
65-XX,FEMALE,Nice Hotel In Paris Our party of three adults spent 3 day in the Hotel Ares in mid-September. We had a good-sized room with two double beds. The room was freshly decorated with yellow walls and nice white carved crown molding. There were large windows in both the bedroom and spacious bathroom that opened onto an interior coutyard not very attractive but the fresh air was great. By Paris standards the bath was huge. The hotel is located in the 15th just a short walk from the Eiffel Tower. It is on a quiet street only a block from shopping restaurants and the metro. The hotel staff was very gracious and helpful. We have stayed in several 3 star hotels in Paris and this is the best by far. The metro station was great as it had access to several lines. We will definitely stay again.
50-64,FEMALE,Great Stay at the Intercontinental Our Room
25-34,FEMALE,Wonderful views dont forget your sunscreen This is a really great property with nice pools and an amazing private island really one of the prettiest places I have ever seen but I say dont forget the sunscreen because if you do its gonna cost you. $20 to be exact. Yep if you forget anything while you are staying here you better be prepared to pay dearly for it. Oh and if you want to eat you better be willing to pay up big time. I am no cheapie but $16 for a burger was a little high and almost $20 for two well drinks was a bit over the top I loved this place but make sure you bring LOTS of extra cash for food drinks parking etc. and try not to leave any essentials at home because they charge a ton for little stuff. We had a great view from our room STAY OCEANFRONT It is such a great thing to wake up to We took our two kids and they loved it especially the awesome pools. I am glad we stayed here but really wish there were some sort of affordable food options there just isnt quite yet.
35-49,MALE,Quality accommodations in the heart of Seattle Whenever I travel on business I now consult tripadvisor reviews prior to my trip. Based on the glowing reviews for this property I chose the Holiday Inn Seattle and I was not disappointed.Centrally located in an urban but commercial section of town the entrance to the hotel on Dexter Avenue is a bit claustraphobic. If there are several arriving you may need to wait your turn to get into the lobby but once you come in the front desk is quick and courteous. After you check in return to your car and turn right into the hotel right behind the hotel and right into the Holiday Inn garage not the Express garage. Swing wide on the last turn because you use your room key to open the garage door from the drivers side. The second time I did this it felt natural Even the parking garage is well done. Although the spaces are small the ceiling has an acoustical treatment making the garage quiet and relatively warm: a great benefit for Seattle weather.My room was large for a standard room with two queen beds and a sleeper sofa. The TV has a sleep timer controlled on the TV itself and about 20 channels of cable. There are several nice touches in the room in the form of instruction cards on how to operate the TV and internet wired only... bring your ethernet cable or be billed $7.50 The iron and board in my room were passable but somewhat damaged by previous guests. The in-wall heater/AC was quiet and there was little to no outside noise that disturbed my sleep.The other amenities are somewhat limited by the small size and location of the hotel. I noticed that the exercise room is somewhat larger than most with several cardio and weight machines. There is a business center with computer printer and high-fee ATM machine.One of the other reviews raved about the Emerald Grill. I found their food above average but nothing to write home about. However for room service and a general service hotel... thats the kind of food you want. Room service was delivered in a timely fashion and at correct temperatures. Tip: If you want bread with your room service meal you need to request it.Most of my days were spent away from the hotel so I dont have any reviews of their ballroom or other facilities. However I dont hesitate to recommend this location - its a quality property.
25-34,FEMALE,Highlight of our trip We loved Damai Lovina Villas www.damai.com. Damai was our honeymoon splurge at the end of our trip. If youre staying at other places during your trip I would recommend staying here last as nothing else could possibly compare favorably :- Its way up on the northern coast of Bali not really near anything city wise. The villas were gorgeous the pool magnificent and the food 5 star. There are only 6 villas on the property so you eventually get to know the other people staying there. We did the dinner and dolphin package and the dophin tour was amazing We saw a ton of them. Its expensive though rooms tours and food so be aware of that. Of all the places we stayed Damai is the one we still talk about all the time. sigh
50-64,FEMALE,PeacefulPosh and Good Value My husband and I have just returned from a holiday trip to Paris. After mind boggling searches for the PERFECT hotel.I think I have found it. Hotel de Varenne is sophisticated without being pretentious. Staff helpful and courteous. Great location.Very peaceful nights sleep. Pleasantly surprised by the bathroom size as Id been lead to believe all hotel bathrooms in Paris are tiny. I hope to return to Hotel de Varenne to enjoy this lovely place again.
65-XX,MALE,Luxury and location If you have the money this is a great place to stay. I was fortunate enough to be able to use my Starwood points so I didnt need to count the euros. Service was excellent at check in and departure and our room was comparable to the Meridien in the US. The hotel has recently been renovated and everything looked new. The beds were comfortable and faced a 50 inch plasma TV on the opposite wall. The bathtub was huge and had a rubber incline so you could lean back comfortably. And of course a separate shower. Bath amenities were the same that I used to get at the Meridien in Beverly Hills.The hotel location was right on the Ramblas only a block or two from the Plaza de Catalunya. There were cabs galore and a convenient metro too.All in all a great place to have has your home base in a beautiful city.
25-34,MALE,Great little hotel in the real san francisco Great little hotel out of the way but if you have got a city pass you can catch the tram down to the main attractions. Very good staff and friendly. Extra bonus was the free parking on offer as parking in san francisco is very hard to get. Very old typical san francisco hotel which had loads of character offers free breakfast in the morning too which was very nice. Also if you are in between 4 - 6 pm you get free cherry and biscuits in the lounge. We stayed here for 6 days and enjoyed every minute of it loads of great restaurants to eat at and plenty of shopping to do too. We went to alcatraz on a night tour which i recommend booking before you go as i gets very busy. Also hired some bikes and did a 16 mile bike ride and caught the ferry back. Had a great six days
50-64,FEMALE,Bring flipflops and earplugs I needed a place for the night before a cruise on the S.S. Lane Victory at 7:30 a.m. the following morning.Strangely although the room was very clean the furniture in good shape and the bed comfortable the carpet of Room 215 was FILTHY. It made the soles of my feet black within five minutes of my stepping out of the shower. If you take the trouble to scrupulously clean the rest of the room why not shampoo the carpet once in a while?Also though the hotel appeared to be barely occupied the desk clerk claimed it was full and wouldnt give me a quieter room on the back side of the hotel. In the rooms facing Gaffey Street the traffic sounds are LOUD cars with thumping speakers at all hours; big rigs downshifting for the stoplight half a block away; police sirens. I had to leave the air on all night to try to muffle the noise. Also as mentioned in other reviews the neighborhood looks a bit iffy and I wouldnt walk around there after dark. The 21 Sushi restaurant next door was good and reasonably priced; it was frequented by regular local customers many of whom the owner greeted by name.If the carpet were cleaner this would be a good hotel for the price.
18-24,FEMALE,A Great Little Hotel Mini Bar
35-49,MALE,A cut above We have just returned from 12 lovely nights in Barcelona staying at this hotel. It is in a great location about 12 mins on metro from Las Ramblas then maybe about a 7 mins walk from nearest metro selva de mar to the hotel. The room was great comfiest bed ever and the much needed aircon was a life saver. Bathroom massive. It is ideal if you are looking for more of a beach hol which we were. The beach is literally across the street and what a lovely beach it is. There are wee beach shacks all along selling food and drink and djs every weekend til 3/4 in the am lots of locals partying hard We bought the multi-trip metro tickets and found these cheap and easy to use. There is a great shopping centre Diagonal Mar 5 mins from hotelloads of eating places in the shopping centre too. There are about 4 chinese restaurants near the hotel only one of which I would recommend. As you leave the hotel turn left and it is about 3 blocks down. Cheap as chips Although they dont sell them The Chinese and Indian restaurants are defintely the cheapest in town.. Olympic Port is about a half hour walk away down at the harbour with loads of tavernas and pubs and a couple of discos. A couple of bars have bands in til 3am. But be warned take plenty cash cos its not cheap there. If youre not prepared to walk back to hotel dont leave it too late to get a taxi theres no chance after about 1.30 or 2am. We walked back a few times All in all I would say if you are going for a short trip then you would probably be better off nearer Las Ramblas but for a longer holiday its a great hotel for access to the beach for lazy days and to the metro for sightseeing and shopping Enjoy
35-49,MALE,Perfect to propose This place is fantastic. I was originally booked into another hotel in Venice but due to flood repairs they called to cancel us and I was very dissapointed. This was a suprise holiday for my then girlfriend it was her birthday and she had always wanted to go to Italy. So right up to the day it was a suprise where we were going.The hotel was so magical so much so that before we had even checked our bags in I took her out to the balcony and proposed to her I had planned on doing it at some stage during our 3 days there but the view from the balcony was perfect she said yes and we were married 2 and a half weeks ago.We hope to come back for one of our anniversaries. The staff were lovely and the room - just at the top of the stairs to the right as you walk towards the balcony - was perfectI can highly reccomend this place and it will always hold a special place in our hearts.
50-64,MALE,Luxury hotel with atmosphere If you would like to stay someplace that has high end luxury with touches of charm from a bygone era then the Adolphus is for you. Sure it has all the features you would expect of a high end hotel--great attentive service spacious rooms beautiful tasteful furnishings comfortable beds etc. However the Adolphus is unique in the way it preserves and pays tribute to its past. All throughoutthe hotel and the rooms you see wonderfully ornate reminders of yesteryear--chandeliers lamps mirrors bureaus clocks lobby furniture etc. This creates a great atmosphere of sophistication and luxury. If you have any question as to whether the Adolphus is a hotel that is luxurious enough for you remember that Queen Elizabethand Prince Phillip stayed here during their visit to Texas.
35-49,FEMALE,Great boutique hotel Exactly as promised. We had a two room apartment 25m which was larger than we expected. Very nice mini kitchen facilities which allowed for coffee making and small meals. Clean nicely furnished rooms and hotel is located on a quiet dead end street in a great area in the heart of the latin quarter within walking distance of everything. Front desk staff spoke perfect english and had great recommendations for local cafes and restaurants. Be sure to check out le Petit Prince  5 min walk for an authentic french dinner. Would highly recommend checking the hotels website directly for last minute deals as we got a fantastic rate.
25-34,FEMALE,Loved the Occidental Will go back again one of the pools
65-XX,FEMALE,Great service overall but... Just returned from Majestic Colonial resort Punta Cana. Not having been to the region prior nor knowing anyone who had we had no idea what to expect. I believe this contributed to some sense of disappointment with this trip. The grounds are beautiful the place is immaculately clean. The employees are busy busy bees... always cleaning sweeping replacing doing their best to maintain everything and they will do everything to attempt to satisfy your needs. The selling point of the resort seems to be the fact that it is all-inclusive; all one can eat and especially drink.The problem for us was 1 the food was terrible tho there was always great effort to present it attractively and 2 not being heavy drinkers we found little to do other than lounge by the pool . Because of weather conditions of course the resort had no control over the storm which kept everyone off the beach for two days the pool area was quite crowded and short of lounging chairs. Not being near even a small city shopping area we never saw much of the life of the country. We did take the one day trip to the Island for beach and BBQ. This trip was nice but way too long. It was a 2-hr bus ride to the marina where we boarded a catamaran. Following our time on the beach we had another looong return ride to the hotel. WhewFamilies with small children seemed to have a good time with the youngsters being able to plop around the pool; and certainly the hearty drinkers enjoyed the never empty glass of whatever it was they wanted to drink. My advice then would be to take a good book or two snag a lounge chair just relax read and drink up. For us it just wasnt enough.
65-XX,MALE,We love Catalonia Our 4th time in Catalonia Bavaro. We stayed there in April for 2 weeks in paradise.We are a couple over 60. and have been traveling to different places in the world.What we liked the most :- excellent customer service from the management  customer service staff animationto waiters and greeters at the restaurants cleaning ladies in our room gardeners etc..- beautiful beach- good accommodation with non smoking rooms- excellent food.We even noticed at different occasions Mr Juana one of the manager greeting the guests at the main dinner buffet restaurant. We were in a non smoking building next to the swimming pool and close to the beach and beach restaurant.We enjoyed the professional band playing most of the nights. We made sure that we were there from 8pm to 8.30 pm. They played ballroom dancing for half an hour rumba chacha. They even played a foxtrot and a tango for us.After 45 minutes of children animation the band come back and play 45 minutes of social dancing meringue salsa bachata etcThe shows are very good. They practiced every morning to give the best performance at night.The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. It is a big resort we did a lot of walking. They sprayed quite every day in different areas and we did not get any mosquitos bites.We had and excellent weather. We enjoyed been there for the 4th time. Its like being at home. We knew a few people from the staff. They treated us in a special manner. As one the manager mentioned to me you a personal friend and part of the Catalonia family.We will be glad to go back.
25-34,MALE,Great Hotel Ideal position in Granada What Else ? ;- Granada is one of the most beautifull city in Europe and this Hotel is the best way to have a wonderfull stay.Its my second trip in this Hotel and I have nothing to say about. Room clean first time we stay in a normal room and in the Allambra Suite for our second stay.Just a remarq about the bedin the normal room which is a little bit too smooth for me.But the suite ....................... try it you will enjoy 
65-XX,MALE,Excellent Choice for Theater Weekend We were part of a family group of three couples who stayed at the Omni in the beginning of January for a theater weekend. We booked broadway tickets through a special we saw on travelzoo and then used their site to search for hotels. The Omni was very reasonable so we used the travelzoo discount code and booked online at the Omnis site. We are very pleased we stayed there. The room was spacious bathroom large and staff very friendly. I really liked their web check-in process. We said wed be there at 11:30AM showed up on time and our keys were ready on arrival. I appreciated that they treated us with great care even though wed booked using a discount. All three couples enjoyed the hotel and agreed wed like to stay there when we do our 2009 theater weekend.
50-64,MALE,Wonderful hotel wonderful staff Just returned from the Villa Mazarin Hotel.....truly fantastic location in the beautiful and intriguing Marais district - and sited just behind the Hotel DVille  City Hall .The hotel is small  29 rooms only  and has been stunningly refurbished......Our room  standard double  was terrific....flat-screen TV world-class bed two sinks kettle iron and ironing board etc......The hotel is in the heart of the Marais district....a cultural and bohemian extravaganza..........stuffed with bars/restaurants of any kinds and types  gay hetro loud quiet cute etc etc The real bonus however was the hotel staff who were amongst the most attentive and professional I have ever come across in more than 30 years of world travel.....nothing was too much trouble for them.We would return tomorrow given the opportunity.Ian and Kathryn  UK If anyone requires any more info we are happy to provide...hicduk@aol.com
65-XX,FEMALE,Good Place with suggestions This is a quiet very comfortable place to stay in a notoriously expensive and noisy city. Best rates are on the hotels website we prepaid $159 per night for bed and breakfast plus an additional $19.22 per night in taxes and we would stay there again in a flash. The hotel is soundproof and the location is perfect only steps away from the Bush/Powell intersection and an easy jaunt to all of downtown. The California street Cable Car line is two blocks up Nob Hill; Market Street is five short blocks south. We didnt have a car but the hotel offers in-and-out valet parking for $38 per night a pretty good rate considering you are in the heart of The City.Dinner in the hotels restaurant Daffodils was only so-so however; husbands flatiron steak was superb but my pork tenderloin entree was dry and tasteless very overcooked. The waitress said the chef prefers to serve the pork rare probably because he has never heard of trichinosis and has no idea how easy it is to cook a pork tenderloin to non-pink tender perfection. Whatever I suggest you select something else from what seemed to be a relatively limited somewhat precocious menu. Be aware that there are tiny easily overlooked coupons at the far end of the reception desk that knock $20 off your dinner bill. The restaurant didnt seem very busy on any of the three nights we were in residence; perhaps the management should put one of those $20 coupons in with the room key at check-in. The European-style breakfast buffet was more than adequate and included juices cold cuts cheese tomatoes hard-boiled eggs assorted cereals with yogurt available a variety of fruit delicious croissants and muffins bread and bagels for toasting teas coffee and so on. Hot breakfasts were available at an extra charge.We had the San Francisco Chronicle outside our door every morning and both USA Today and the Wall Street Journal were also complimentary at the front desk.The room had free wireless and the bathroom was large and well appointed with good linens. Shower/Tub was clean with excellent water pressure. Little noise transferred from adjacent rooms. The in-room coffee was not memorable. Elevators were prompt and swift.The beds are cloud-like almost too much so. After an uncomfortably hot first night alternating between the too hot duvet and too cold sheet as a cover we requested a regular blanket rather than the fluffy duvet -- problem solved. The huge pillows are deep and fluffy nice if thats want you like but miserable if you prefer something smaller and firmer. A selection of pillows amid the six on the bed would have been much appreciated.The decor is very tailored with extremely nice furnishings and the staff was highly professional and pleasant. All in all the Orchard proved to be ideal for our all-too-short stay in SF.
25-34,MALE,Ive stayed in better 3 star hotels Upon being upgraded to an apartment we were horrified to be stepping into a smoky non-smoking room. The decor was far from impressive especially the cheap and tacky bits of chipboard passing for a bathroom cabinet.The robotic hotel reception staff seemed quite unplussed at my dissatisifaction when I raised the above.The breakfast experience at the Garden Buffet was more like attending a food court than a 5 star dining room. Upon arrival the queue to get a table was more like attending the local club RSL pokies venue. While the choice of food was impressive and well displayed and tasty the sight of bus-boy trolleys clearing tables reminded me of the food court at the local Westfield shopping centre. Plus queuing for the egg station to have an omelete made would have been a novel experience if I could have been bothered.In future we will be returning to the Wentworth were the experience is truly 5-star.
25-34,FEMALE,One night at Hyatt harborside Stayed one night friday at Hyatt harborside as we had a transatlantic flight to catch at 9am. We check in during the early afternoon with the plan to spend the afternoon /early evening in Boston. Our plan worked well and is worth considering for those with a morning flight out of Logan.No queue to check in on arrival left luggage with bellman headed up to the room - luggage was delivered within 10 mins. Our room on 9th floor had a fantastic Harbor view - so good you could take a photo from the room.Room had 2 Queen beds medium to firm matress with good quality linens room was decorated in a modern style. Armchair by window ipod docking station bathroom with tub shower but no bathrobes. Toiletries were basic - I have to admit though am not a fan of the hyatts portico toiletries. Room was clean but not overly large. Glasses ice bucket provided ice machine on each floor. NO aiport noise whatsoever from the room but you can hear noise from the corridor - lucky for us we had quiet neighboursThe lift is fun - you get a waterview as you travel up downThere is a nice patio area outside where you can dine or have a drink with a great view at night the staff light candles lanterns its quite lovely - but the indoor bar area was a dissapointment not inviting not a place to linger. Staff seemed overstreched but remained polite. Food was good but not great Calamari appitizer was very large enough for 2 and tasty.The water taxi is available just outside the hotel - be sure to use the walkie talkie to call for a taxi as they appear to wait offshore rather than at the dock. We used the service to get to Boston it was a fun experience. Taxi service runs till 10pm so you do not have to dine at the hotel restaurant.Although hotel was busy the pool/gym was empty we used both. Lockers/towels provided water cool towels apples were available. Pool is saltwater affords you a view of the harbor whilst you swim The jacuzzi was very hot. There is also a sauna which we did not use - With the heatwave Boston was expereincing we were hot enough.Early morning bellstaff came for luggage we had a short wait for one of the two free shuttles to the airport.
50-64,FEMALE,Fantastic view We stayed at the Four Points by Sheraton for New Year. We were on the 10th flloor abd the view over Darling Harbour was amazing. Room was very comfortable and the king sized bed a joy to get into especially after our stop over from Singapore. We slept 13 hour solid as the soundproofing was also extremely good. all the staff were very helpful and the doormaneeven managed to hail a taxi for us on New Years Eve to get down to the Rocks. Would definetely stay again.
65-XX,MALE,Not Great but Okay This property is a little tired. Needs some refurbishing. Theyre working on the exterior lanais etc. presently.Rooms are simply furnished. The musty odour It is the tropics after all disappears quickly after the a/c is turned on. Again furniture carpet fixtures have seen better times. On the other hand the rooms are large and serviceable with a fridge and coffee maker. I was quite satisfied for the price. Staff are very helpful. Checked my bags for me as I had a late flight. In addition there is a hospitality room on the third floor for a shower and change of clothes before leaving for the airport. The 16th floor is the site of the continental breakfast served on the lanai. Could get crowded Im told but as Im an early riser no problems for me.There is an ABC store on site that can supply you with most anything. There is also a tour desk which is quite handy. Getting around? The Bus stop is outside the main entrance although everything in Wakiki is within walking distance.Id definetely use this property again. Good value good location super staff.By the way Waikiki can be expensive. Walk a few blocks to escape the beach area and youll find lots of great inexpensive bars and restaurants.
50-64,MALE,Could Not Wait To Leave If you want Dominican service at New York prices then this is the place for you. We experienced all of the pitfalls discussed in other reviews -- bone jarring ride from airport lackluster food ridiculous costs and the feeling that once you get there youre trapped in a Dominican Bizarro World of rip-offs designed exclusively for foreign tourists.Then add to that the huge man eating spiders in our luxurious ocean front room. I am traumatized and to this day am still afraid to open my underwear drawer at home. As mentioned many guests have either scalding hot water or ice cold water from the showers. A tropical squall flooded a couple of ocean front rooms with an inch of water while folks upstairs with the thatched roof experienced little worms and insects falling from the ceiling. I hope they slept with their mouths closedThese are the stories of the folks that traveled with us as part of a corporate reward / retreat for my company. Of the seven couples that went we all had freaky little horror stories. Our stay was a lesson in Dominican dysfunction which would be cute if it were not supposed to be at a luxury resort. Nor is it cure that you are presented with a water menu whenever you dare to eat there. Several in our party became ill from the food. They tell you the water from the tap is undrinkable and then sell you $8 bottles of water with your meal. I found the local rum to be both tastier and cheaperThe front desk staff was ill equipped to handle any of the cavalcade of issues their hotel was presenting its guests. For example they were unable to offer me change for a $50 bill and had no stamps for my postcards. although they promised to send them for me and I paid them to mail them. my little nieces and nephews never received their cards. In addition the internet connections promised in the rooms were again predictably not working.The spa semed to have lots of nice things in it but the whirlpool was lukewarm and the stream room was not working. The sauna was nice when they remembered to turn it on -- which seemed to be every other day. They invested a lot of money into the spa to not have it functioning properly and such seemed to typify both the Agua resort and the surrounding area.When we tried to escape from Agua and venture to go out for dinner one night to the nearby Al Navigante we were again subject to another fiasco. When we were served wine that had turned to vinegar they tried to charge us for the bad wine. They also added two additional dinners to the tab. When I protested the extra charges they tried to negotiate. Indeed -- they exemplified the apparent Dominican business ethic when dealing with tourists: Take them for all you canA day trip to a Dominican cigar factory took us to a shop in Bavaro run by a woman from Switzerland who had two guys rolling stogies and while the guys in our group smoked free samples the ladies were shown local jewelry for purchase. Indeed it seemed as if the only place where we were being scammed worse than in the hotel was just anywhere else in the DRYes there were some positives. The wait staff at Agua was entirely friendly and they seemed to genuinely enjoy teaching Spanish to my wife and I. Also the beach is very nice and the water was inviting. However the water was also pretty cloudy when we were there and I am told it is largely unsuitable for snorkeling.When our week was over we were all very anxious and quite happy to leave. Again predictably the driver was late to pick some of our fellow travelers up. They were late to the airport and almost missed their flights.Perhaps luxury resort and the Dominican Republic are mutually exclusive. It sure seemed so at Agua. After all in the DR even the sidewalks have potholes Yes the people we met were for the most part very nice unless you had to deal with money and the beach was very nice. However there are far too many negatives to outweigh the few positives and Agua charges way too much to expect its guests to overlook those negatives. To Agua I say Adios and good riddance
25-34,FEMALE,Place to sleep and shower. I stayed in the Coqui Inn beginning of March 2008. I had seen the place online before going to Puerto Rico and it did not look too bad for the price. The grafetti mural walls through me off a little and I was iffy on booking the place based on the unknown of the area. We went to PR and family was going to find us a cheap place close to the coast-beach that did not happen. So an hour after getting off flight from NYC we contacted a few places that were $140 + a night went to see like 3 of them...rooms looked like blah for that price and we didnt want to spend alot of $. The vacation was like an extended weekend cheap get away to the beach kinda thing.So there I was trying to get directions to the place on the phone dealt with 3 different people. The address for place does not come up on a GPS system at least not a tom-tom. Finally found it. Much easier than they explained. The enterance is around the back and it has multiple doors to get into the facility and confusing to find main lobby. We finally get in there is one woman waiting on the sofa... one lady behind the counter and one manager in the office. it takes like hour-two to get checked in. the clerk made a money mistake refund transaction before and now the manager locked the system down and they can not enter any reservations. so she tells us to wait dont give a specific amount of time. I tell her i saw a room online for $89 per night and it is the two of us. We get handed like 4 sets of keys told to pick a room. first we took a top room- not connected to others. two beds inside- twin and double. sheets are clean bathroom looked clean except the tile work in the shower stall was kinda busted up. could use TLC and a complete paint job. Huge refrigerator in room was a plus. Very cold. Light bulbs were burnt out my Husband went to desk to exchange 2 of them they said someone will come to room - no one did. we didnt stress it. The second day we had NO hot water or water pressure. After 3 attempts water and hot water running. 2nd day no such luck. After a long day and having a early morning ahead of us we had to repack all our stuff and move to another room... we had choice of another 3 rooms we settled on this other room that may not have been the right oneI forgot to mention that the room cost us $79. After complaining at check in that we waited so long.... we got the room at that rate. Back to room 2. Nicer cleaner new paint job bathroom a little tiny bit more up to date... not perfect but it worked for sleep and shower purposes. Well water pressure and temperature were great...This room had two double beds and a stove crappy some dishes and a pot and pan and utensils. not a bad gesture but.... nothing I would make meals on. Fridge was smaller but still nice to have. We bought some 12 pack soda at Wallgreens milk and cereal and throw away bowls...The air conditioner was terrible terrible. At this point I opened the slatted windows and turned on the fan I gave up switching rooms. The front door was metal slatted and you could force the slats open from the outside of the room and stick your hand in and open the doorknob lock. Not cool to leave ANYthing of value behind. We also hung the do not disturb sign to aviod wondering if maid service was going to go through our stuff. Cameras througout the property inbetween walkways to rooms made safe however not enought lighting outdoors. the place is basically enclosed when your inside it seems like it was once 3 seperate hotel-motels smushed together...The space around the Coqui was nice. sitting areas pools were all very clean and everything outside was maintained with decent landscaping... some chairs and hammocks... the floors are tile in some areas of the place and became very slippery and no wet floor signs left out. I noticed 4 computers in the lobby area with people planted infront of them. COME ON YOUR On Vacation... Get off the computer and go the the beach They sold soda and ice cream and stuff. I saw the coffee pot they never mentioned the freee coffee or breakfast stuff nor did I care to ask for it. Bottom line: you get what you pay for. $79 was not expensive for us and we got a shower and a clean bed. Not a fancy place. Staff is nice but soooo slow when doing things. I would stay again if I needed a cheap vacation. But would also consider renting a timeshare or small apartment for a week at about the same price.My advise to all dont waste your money on taxi or tours ones that you can do yourself like Morro and Yunque. Rent a car. Its like $19 a day without optional insurance. you can go to different beaches like pinones and fajado ... not restricted to busy san juan... try charlie cars for a rental.Good luck
50-64,MALE,Funky and well located some windowless rooms It was very fine to stay at the Regina three nights for a nearby conference at the university. A bit on the expensive side but it was generally modern elegant attractive and funky. Free fully functioning in room WIFI included. First I was put in a very small room with no windows I did not like that It was changed next day no problem. Lively streets but excellent glazing keeps it quiet inside if you prefer. Breakfast is good but expensive they almost seemed to panic when they discovered I was having breakfast one morning not included in my deal but relaxed when I flashed my key and credit card. Starbucks is right next door not too cheap either but nice outside seating. The location of the hotel is very good near Metro sightseeing bus start shopping and head of las Ramblas. I would gladly stay here again for business or pleasure but be more alert about getting a good room from the start.
50-64,FEMALE,Nice get-a-way at the Rui Bambu I just returned from a 3 night get away to the D.R. at the Riu Bambu.The grounds are very well kept and the beach is perfect Lots of palm trees for shade and you can walk for miles. The Colonial buffet is really very good with a huge selection. All of the cold foods were kept on an iced surface and the hot foods constantly were replaced. The a la carte restaurants were not nearly as good as the buffet. We only went to them for a change and to be served. Beds and pillows are really too hard as the other reviews said.The room was very clean despite the Mildew/Lysol smell that I always notice in the caribbean. We went on the outback safari tour to see more of the Dominican country side. It was very informative and lots of fun but too many stops to buy trinkets all owned by outback safari and the included lunch was bland - not the spicey dominican food promised. Brush up on your spanish - english is not often spoken and americans were in the minority. Lots of Germans French and Italians. Be prepared to see topless ladies at the beach. We took a walk up the beach to the flea market and had fun haggling for price. Thought we got a good price and them found the same things at the airport shops for about the same price Remember not to drink the tap water and be warned that Montezumas revenge got me on the plane home and it can get you All in all a nice place with a beautiful beach.
50-64,MALE,Great place for the right price This can be a great place to stay depending on what you pay. We booked this on Priceline bidding for $115 per night. For that price it was a steal. We booked it for before and after a cruise. It is actually a very nice hotel in a great location and has an excellent pool and beach. The hotel has a large open air lobby which is nice but not as classy as the Wyndham El San Juan but nice enough. The hotel has been built in phases over the years. We were in the original building which I prefer since all of the rooms have great water views. Some of the later buildings have sections that look out on other buildings and parking garage etc. The rooms are a decent size with nice bathrooms and very nice beds and bedding. The furniture is a little dated. The hotel has an excellent location on a peninsula into the water on the outskirts of Old San Juan. You are only about a 10 minute ride from the cruise ships and Old San Juan. If you are looking for a lot of nightlife and shopping outside your door this is not the place for you. The nicest part of the hotel is the beach and pool area. The beach is on its own cove not much in the way of waves but otherwise very nice. It has a great pool area and a nice area with hammocks and palm trees for shade. We are members of the Hilton Honors and were put on the club floor. The club floors have the use of a very nice lounge with free snacks drinks newspapers and computer. For $115 per night this was a great deal. We were originally booked at the Marriott for the stay on the return from the cruise but at $350 a night for the Marriott and $155 for the Hilton it was a no brainer. If you are going to pay $350 a night I would consider the El San Juan or the Marriott but with the discount rates on the Hilton it is well worth it. My only complaint was that it does not have a casino so you need to get a cab to go to a casino or to go to other restaurants. We ate at the Mortons on a great web promotion 2 excellent meals for $99 but the other hotel restaurants looked very overpriced. They do have a Starbucks in the lobby.
35-49,FEMALE,Great Location and would recommend Stayed for 3 nights in the Belvedere Hotel and was delighted with the room. From what I understand rooms in New York can be quite small so we was pleasantly surprised. For the price we paid this is great value. If you are looking for pure luxury - look elsewhere. If you are looking for a comfortable 3 star in a good location with pleasant staff and a decent sized clean and comfortable room then this is what you getOur room was on the 17th floor and had a little kitchenette with coffee maker - coffee suplied - also microwave. The bathroom was small - as other reviewers have said - but it had everything and there was nothing to complain about. Shower was very good.We arrived a little early but our room was ready and we were able to check in. We were also allowed to check out a little later when departing which was great - they held our bags after that.We never had problem with the lifts - probably as we were on the top floor. Once it arrived up it was usually empty - however when it stopped at the various floors on the way down - it was often full. Lifts are definitely small.We had breakfast included in the price and it was very good. It would be very expensive it if were not included. Continental was about $13 and full american was nearly $20. The continental included tea coffee breads cakes cereal fruit cheese etc. The American had in addition suasage bacon eggs home fries pancakes french toast. Plently places close by for breakfast otherwise.The location is great and we always felt safe walking around. We ate in the mexican next door one evening - Sombrero - and it was nice. There are plenty bars and restaurants close by and I would definitely stay again - we went to The Social gets a bit noisy after 5 Hurleys Pigalle just to name a few.We flew to Newark and got the NJ Transit to Penn - taxi only $8 to hotel. We got a taxi back to airport - hotel porters got it for us - - it was $80 including tip.Would have no hesitation recommending hotel or staying there again
35-49,MALE,Okay Hotel in the University District of Seattle My wife and I travel to Seattle four or five times a year. As a couple that enjoys boutique hotels my wife and I found the Watertown Hotel to be satisfactory but certainly nothing to get excited about. We usually stay at one of the Kimpton Hotels there are three in Seattle but all three Kimpton Hotels were sold out for the July 6 to 8 2007 weekend due to the Kenny Chesney Flip Flop Summer Tour 2007 so we looked over Seattle hotel reviews on Tripadvisor. The Watertown Hotel was the only top 5 rated hotel in Seattle with a room available they told me on the telephone it was their last available room so we booked the room for $185 plus tax per night. The Watertown Hotel is located in the University district about six miles north of downtown Seattle. It is a safe area with plenty of restaurants located within walking distance of the hotel. Our room like the property itself was clean and well looked after. The room had a comfortable King bed basic washroom tiny fridge and a small television set. Our room was located off the elevator lobby on the fifth floor so there was a lot of hall noise until well past midnight both nights of our stay. There is free secured parking located under the hotel for hotel guests but the parking stalls are tiny and the ceiling only six feet six inches high so larger vehicles may have problems parking. Also the breakfast selection was not satisfactory limited items with no fruit or healthy eating options so we wandered over to the Farmers Market five blocks away for breakfast one morning and we drove to the 14 Carrot Cafe for beakfast the second day located a couple miles from the Watertown Hotel at 2305 Eastlake Ave E on the way to downtown Seattle. In summary we would stay at the Watertown Hotel again but it will never be our first choice in the Seattle area.
50-64,FEMALE,This Is A Great Resort Very Happy From South Carolina Having a drink at Margaritas
18-24,FEMALE,Clean and nice NIce new clean rooms. Stayed with friends for a bachlorette party. One downside no full length mirror in room. A word of advice dont keep your window open at night because in the morning youll hear the duck tour. Other than that an awesome hotel with friendly staff.
50-64,MALE,Enjoyed Hotel DAlbe Glimpse of the river from the room
35-49,MALE,Wonderful experience I arrived at the hotel at 9pm during height of Xmas party season.I hold a Gold card and had booked online at fairly short notice. Arriving at 9pm following a drinks party I was told there was no record of my reservation. I looked at my printout and realised I had booked for January by mistakeFront desk managed to find me the last room in hotel very impressed. Lovely meal in the Roux Brasserie have the salmon followed by skirt of beef
25-34,MALE,Perfect Charming stay at Hotel Rivoli Our big room
50-64,MALE,Great location good priced hotel We picked this hotel because we could easily get a train from the airport to Wynyard and also it was close to the cruise terminal where we would be departing from on the following day. I had also stayed several times in this hotel when it was known as the Corus. Even though the Corus was ok it is nice to see it being renovated.We had a nice size renovated room no problems. On Check in they did not have our booking and I think they tried to sort it out with the agent over the phoe after about 15 mins we were in our room. Although our booking was room only when i enquired about the cost of breakfast next morning the desk advised it was included in our room charge so that was a bonus. Breakkie was nice.All in all Im glad we chose this hotel.
25-34,MALE,Our second stay. Just as pleasant as the first. Room picture
25-34,FEMALE,Lovely hotel This is perfect spot to be staying in the hub of it all yet down a traditional side street with plenty of atmosphere not the huge bussle of the ramblas. We had a super trip climbing the stairs in gaudi cathedral a must some fantastic local tapas 3 course meal restaurants down little streets in the gothic quarter. You need to explore by foot to discover the best restaurants. We also went to a beach out the city which was well worth it for a day of relaxing in the sun called sitges. Enjoy
35-49,MALE,Nice place. Loved the free parking. Close to cable cars. The top of Lombard St. looking at Fishermans Wharf. Alcatraz in background.
35-49,FEMALE,Enjoyable stay at the Colon Hotel The hotel was very clean but could use some updating worn carpets paint chipping. Our room faced the interior courtyard so there was no view but it was very quiet. The cathedral was under construction while we were there so paying more for a room with a view would not have been worth it in my opinion. The location was fantastic. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were surprised by the 2 twin beds but we made the best of it. The internet service was very expensive. Much cheaper to go to an internet cafe but not as convenient. Mini-bar prices were reasonable. Overall a great time in Barcelona
25-34,FEMALE,Perfect Four adults stayed here for four nights and had a great time. We came for the Yankee / Red Sox series so we werent in the room all that much. None the less the room was spacious and clean. The hotel is centrally located. We never encountered any wait problems with the elevators. I would highly recomment this hotel to a traveler.
25-34,MALE,The Queen of Nob Hill Continues to Reign My partner and I stayed at the Fairmont SF over Halloween weekend and both of us couldnt be more pleased with our experience. I personally have stayed at the Fairmont multiple times prior but the last time was 6 years ago so this experience seemed new to me as well. Everything and everyone we encountered at the Fairmont was first class. The timeless elegance of the Grand Lobby envelopes you in opulence without feeling stiff or too cold. Our arrival was processed swiftly and efficiently and we were ensconced in our room with our luggage within 10 minutes of walking through the doors even though we arrived over 2 hours prior to the official check in time. Im a member of the Presidents Club so we were upgraded without asking to a corner room on the 9th floor of the Tower Building which was just fine with us. I personally would rather have the breathtaking views of the Bay and Coit Tower out of one set of windows and the SOMA district out of the others. The concierge was extremely attentive and helpful with every request as were the room service attendants that we came in contact with. The hotel is located in a great location to traverse the city via any of the many forms of public transit available. The Fairmont truly is a wonderful hotel to stay at whether it be for a special occasion or just a get away from it all weekend. I cannot recommend it highly enough. We will surely be returning here when we come back to beautiful San Francisco again.
50-64,MALE,I would never go back I was there from July 12-July 19.First the hotel and beach are beautiful. However the hotel front desk managers are incompetent and have no idea of the meaning of good customer service. I had booked the 1 bedroom Majestic Colonial suite and they did not have it when I arrived. I was given a room that was 2 categories lower. Additionally they never apologized for not having my room available when I arrived. They acted like they were doing me a favor by helping me at all.Also we were not taken to our room. We were given verbal directions to the room and we were lost as the place is so big. Victor the general manager would not come out of his office to talk with me. On 3 separate occasions he sent different managers to talk with me. I asked the mangers to tell Victor to come out and talk with me but he never did. They tried to compensate us with a massage for my girlfriend and myself but as we have back issues we told them that we needed a different form of compensation. It took two days before they agreed to give us a romantic dinner on the beach. When I asked them what the room difference was between the room I paid for and the room I was given they would not tell me. I asked them how I could determine if I was being fairly compensated if I did not know how much the lower cost room was.After further questioning they told me the price was $30 for the two of us. However the price of the room on their own web-site showed over a $150 differenceAs for the dinner I do not eat Seaford so I was supposed to get a non-seafood substitute dinner. When dinner arrived I was given a Cesar salad with lobster this had to be taken back and my girlfriend had to eat alone as the waiter on the beach had to return to the restaurant to get the chicken Cesar salad. Then the appetizer arrived a fish dish. Again I told them I eat it and I was not given a substitute dish. Then for the which was surf and turf they just gave me of the the steak.One day we went back to the room and the card key did not work. We had to wait a while for them to bring us a key. When we asked them what happened to the lock they kind of blamed us and said you store your key near a camera or cell phone. I told them that I did not have a camera or cell phone anywhere within 10 feet of my key and yet they never gave me an apology for the inconvenience.Mike - Astoria NY
50-64,MALE,Very convenient very thin walls This is a very trendy and recently furnished hotel but the sound from the hallways and from the adjacent rooms really ruined an otherwise peaceful stay. :The bed was excellent as were the furnishings the hotel staff was courteous and checkout was fast and efficient.The location is very nice right off Times Square.I had a king bed in the medium size room which was fine for one person two would be okay too...the robe was very thin the TV was good and the internet access was quick. The soaps were nice the bathroom tastefully sparse and small.Storage was acceptable and the carpet was new and clean. The window decorations were good and the windows open another plus if you are there when the air is cooler.The temperature controls were easy to use as was the alarm clock and TV.
25-34,FEMALE,Nice clean hotel GREAT service We stayed at the France Albion recently June 2007 for 4 nights in a Superior Double Room and we loved it. The hotel and the room were very clean and the service was remarkable. We were veryimpressed with this nice 2-star which is definitely a very superior 2-star. This hotel is not luxurious and the rooms are small like they would be in most European hotels but they are not tiny. In any case we were not looking for luxury. When we first walked into the room Room 10 we thought about how small it was but we got over that pretty quick. The room was clean and tidy. The room has a small tv and a safe great plus. Our room had one window overlooking what they call I wish taken a picture so you could see but the which much is what I was told that makes this a Superior room. I guess it makes for a quieter room but in any case Notre Dame de Lorette seemed like very quiet street. If I stay there again I think I would try out the regular room. The bathroom had the usual basic amenities bathrobes were a nice touch a window which makes it nice and bright and a shower/tub. Even in 4-star hotels you may find a dirty or slightly moldy shower curtain but I dont think you ever will in this hotel. There was hot water all the time and good water pressure. I know in France probably want to try a lot of different places to eat but the American-style buffet was really nice. I would definitely recommend trying it scrambled eggs bacon potatoes delicious cheese ham yogurt cereal. Once you sit down they will bring you great coffee and wonderful bread and croissants.Now our favorite part about this hotel was Kelly Kelly works at the front-desk and was extremely nice and helpful. She made recommendations gave us directions marked our maps and even made us reservations for a dinner cruise and a cabaret-show. She is definitely one of the reasons we liked this hotel so much and why recommend it so highly.Two more things...Use the metro... there is a couple of stations a block from the hotel and incredibly easy to get around Once you can explain to the metro person the kind of tickets you want in English and a bitof sign language... Of course if you speak French you will do much much better than us but we had Kelly write it down for us on the second day because the first day we had no luck with a kinda-rude metro lady All the stations have easy-to-understand maps and signs.Also the cabs always take longer than they say they will when you call them and extremely hard to stop one on the street so take that into account. It is a shame I remember the name but there was a wonderful restaurant about two blocks from the hotel with incredible food and great service. We had lunch there on our last day. As soon as I find the business card I will edit this posting... but I did give a card to Kelly so if you are heading there pretty soon ask her it is notthe Fontaine Fiacre she recommended it but we never tried it. Have fun in Paris
25-34,FEMALE,Outdated interior but very friendly staff walking into the room
25-34,FEMALE,Great room and service A special touch for our honeymoon
65-XX,FEMALE,Elegant Hotel with Very Small Dark Rooms We stayed at El Convento for two nights. The public areas of the hotel are elegant and the staff friendly and helpful - although not well-trained or efficient. When we inquired about the message light on our phone going on the second morning that we were there and us not being able to access the message we were expecting a call from our son who was arriving later that day at the hotel the day staff at the hotel was not at all quick to try solving the problem and took several hours trying to figure out the code to access the message it should have been the arrival date but wasnt and finally determined that the message was an old message. They couldnt even figure out how to turn off the message light so it kept on blinking. Finally in the evening the desk clerk knew exactly what to do and fixed the problem in a few seconds.The first room that we were taken to was fairly large but the air conditioner was obviously being worked on part of the ceiling insulation was on the floor and the bellhop immediately called the desk to assign us another room. That room was very small and dark - and not exceptionally clean. The time was getting close to midnight and after a delayed flight and a time change of four hours we just wanted to get to sleep.The wine and cheese hour was very nice with a nice selection of wines and cheeses.We love Old San Juan and El Convento is in a very convenient location. We were able to walk to San Cristobal Fort and took the free trolley to El Morro Fort. The hotel is close to the only remaining city gate. It is also close to lots of shopping.Go to La Bombonera for breakfast 259 Calle San Francisco and be sure to order a Mallorca. Its about a five minute walk from the hotel.
65-XX,MALE,Whoa Nelly My first visit to a Days Inn in 25 years. I got this one onHotwire and was upset based on TAs reports. This is not a bad property for a two * hotel.My room was 216. It was clean everything workedthe bathroom was painted the floor was new and theshower had plenty of hot water. The front desk clerk/manager Angel was friendly and efficient.She rebooted the wireless router for me and I had greatInternet access for free. The breakfast had a waffle maker cereal juice coffee yogurtand mini bagels. There were two kind of muffins. I used the airport shuttle and it took 19 minutes for a pickup.Drivers were friendly. The exercise area has one non working bike but the othertwo machines performed well. In review. Motel was clean everything worked it was as sound proof as any airport property. I suggest a lower floor if you are a light sleeper. I was set for the 4th floor but they changed me to the second. Friendly employees. This is a solid choice contrary to other reviews.
35-49,MALE,Agree much improved. We returned to the MO NY this past weekend for a last minute getaway and were quite impressed. We were there soon after opening and agree with prior reviews about the dismal state of the service then. This seems to be mostly taken care of with a few notable exceptions. The service is still not on par with some similar hotels. For instance at the Four Seasons SF they always know our names by the time we get to the reception desk and everyone miraculously calls us by name throughout the stay. When my partner returns from runs at the FS SF or Ritz Phili the doorman will have water and a towel waiting. Service is simply less personal than I would like at the MO. That being said everyone was very warm and friendly. We booked our room through Platinum Travel though not the FHR rate and were upgraded to a Premier Central Park View room. It was at the end of the hall and shared a vestibule with only one other room a Premier CP View Suite. As a result it was very quiet and we did not hear all the door noise other people have complained of. What can be said except that the view of the entire length of Central Park and Mid-town is spectacular. It is unfortunate that even on the highest floor the Trump building partially obscures things but the view is still quite amazing. Sunrise was great and the reflection of the sunset off the surrounding buildings was also very nice. We have stayed at many of the top hotels in New York and there are few that can provide quality views from the majority of rooms. I also like the aesthetic of the MO more than most top NY hotels which tend to be too traditional and fussy for me. I found the bed extremely comfortable and the shower was wonderful. The bath products are also very nice much nicer than at other MO properties. There has been a lot of criticism of the technology in the rooms and complaints that they are too complex. Perhaps it is my younger age and residue of growing up with computers but it seemd pretty intuitive. The HD LCD TV was great as was the speaker system. The phone took a few minutes to master but then it was easy. I also liked that the LCD TV in the bathroom was adjustable. It was odd though that it didnt have all the channels of the larger TV and that the networks were on different channels. On the negative side the restaurant remains a problem. Though our food was consistent if not overpriced $90 for breakfast daily the service was irregular. They never quite got everything right. We were not served bread the first day but it came the second day. We were given a small amuse one day but not the next. I had to ask for butter for my toast. No huge faux-pas but annoying. Finally one of the thing I like to do if I like a hotel and think I may come back is to ask for a tour of other room types I might book. They did not seem to know what to do with this request. First I was told no problem. Then the second person to get on the phone told me that it was not possible because not only did nobody have time  but I would need to make an appointment with the front office. What did she think I was a reporter wanting to do a story? I was a guest and they should have been happy to show me other rooms. At this time it was 1:30 in the afternoon and she finally said that the only person on staff who could show me around was not going to be back until this afternoon and could I stay in my room until she came back. When I informed her that it was already this afternoon and asked what she meant she said 2 p.m. Seeing as it was was 30 minutes and I had no plans I said fine. When nobody called me by 2:30 I left for the afternoon. Over the course of 2 days they were never able to fulfill my quite simple request. We left without seeing other rooms something that might have enticed me to spend money for a better room or suite next time. Their loss. It wont stop us from returning but was an annoying way to end our stay.
35-49,FEMALE,Fantastic View Great Location Freindly The Balcony
18-24,MALE,Great staff great hotel First off this review is written bearing in mind the fact I paid should have been about on hotelopia.co.uk but I found a discount code for 5 nights in a double room with my girlfriend at the Atenea. I think people should state how much they pay on here not to brag but because what you pay dictates what you expect and therefore how you review. The room was clean and a decent size but expect an apartment ours was more like a bed-sit but this is not a criticism. Small kitchen adequate bathroom sofa very large double bed TV everything you need. The other reviewers who criticize the lack of cutlery crockery and pans etc just needed to ask at reception for whatever they needed as they were more then happy to have plates and cutlery sent up to our room.The food in the restaurant was ok. The gastronomic menu was fairly good value at around 23 euros each nice tapas and then main and postres. The staff were very friendly with good english and the bar waitress makes great sangria.The location is 15 mins walk from Nou camp which was good for us as we went to a match. Its also only a couple of minutes walk from Les Corts metro station. We were a little worried about safety on the metro but found it to be very good. ATMs near by too.The Mussols restaurant near by was nice enough but other than that you probably need to get a taxi to eat out. All in all we really enjoyed our stay at the Atenea. The hotel was fantastic considering the amount I paid and would have been good even if it had cost more.Just a note on pick pockets in Barcelona: I carried a bag across both shoulders and kept it on my hip in front of me and we had no problem. Stick to the main streets dont wear a bag on one shoulder be aware of who is around you particularly on La Rambla and you will be fine
50-64,FEMALE,Jen Hotel Western side of HK Island We stayed at the Jen hotel from 04/03/2008 -14/03/2008. Our room was situated on the 21st floor and had a wonderful view across the harbourwe lay in bed watching the passing ferries and turbojets heading to Macau. The hotel was formerly the Novotel Century Harborview it has undergone a major face lift and is very modern and clean. The hotel is located on the Western part of Hong Kong island which is the old Chinese area it is also home to the University and many HK citizens. The people who live nearby and work in the shops are very friendly.There is a Bank of China about four doors away. A great every day restaurant Tai-Saku about 10 doors down towards the water which was frequented by locals we had somewhat of a celebrity status after our 4th visit...great food for very little money.The housekeeper and the bellboy did a great job with our room and luggage. There is a shuttle bus which drops you off to the Macau ferry Star Ferry the bus/train station in Central and then on to Admiralty. We took two trips into China and did not worry about the extra time to get to the KCR In TST East just enjoyed the Star ferry trip.There are still good bargains to be had at the lovely Stanley Market and the Lanes in Central.Victoria Peak is a must see as is Cafe Deco at the Peak and Simpatico two good eateries. The taxis pull up at the front of the hotel and we used them many times very cheap and convenient.I have recommened this hotel to my sister and her family who will be visiting Hk in Jan 2009. I would have no hesitation in returning to the Jen Hotel it is a great value for money .
25-34,FEMALE,enjoyed and wud stay again we stayed 9 nov for 4 nights having booked directly with the hotel the staff where really helpful and when i emailed them prior to staying asking for some advice they responded straight away. during our stay they continued to be really helpful and always acknowledged us when we were coming and going.we stayed on the 3rd floor [which made me out of breath each time but i knew that when i booked it] the staff took our bags up and brought them down at the end of our stay. the room was nice a fridge which was really useful because there is a amazing deli on the corner a little noisy but so is everywhere in NYThe location brilliant subway on the corner on 14th and 8th [i so lov saying that it makes me sound as if i know what im talking about] Greenwich village round the corner nice walk to [20mins] to Times square etcBreakfast was lovely very relaxed from 8-11 i think breads [different one each day] muffins donuts ect and smoked salmon for the bagels at the wend. the bfast bar was nice during the day as well as there was coffee and biscuits throughout the day and plates and glasses if you wanted to eat take out [the deli was amazing and we couldnt miss the opportunity at least one night]overall really nice what made in special the customer service and Charlie the Cat
50-64,FEMALE,Great starting point to a beautiful city I booked this hotel through Trailfinders and after researching it on tripadvisor.com . Excellent location-just off Union Square-close to not only cable car stop but also Alamo car rental a 5 minute walk away. Chinatown in close proximity too.Small lobby but well staffed efficient reception and very informative trip service desk with adjoining small shopping kiosk.Rooms were fine-dont be put off by the fact there is no air-conditioning-the ceiling fans were fine.Also we expected it to be quite noisy at night-not at all-no problems. No coffee/tea makers in the rooms but in the lobby coffee and teas available around the clock-just help yourself and no charge. Also mouth watering cookies and muffins as well  A jar of sweets-replenished daily-was also in our room. I musnt forget there is even a pillow menu-you can try different pillows to aid your sleep Close by were excellent shopping and dining facilities. We had breakfast twice in the hotel-daily specials-all around $9. Ive had better but it was very convenient.Staff throughout the hotel were very helpful without being in your face.I would thoroughly recommend this as an excellent base to explore this beautiful city and surrounding area-about 35 minute walk to Fishermans Wharf so take a cab.
50-64,FEMALE,Gem in a quiet area. This hotel was booked for us by a theatre break website so we didnt know much about it beforehand. However we werent disappointed. The hotel exterior is being renovated at present so first impressions werent great but a fast efficient courteous check-in rooms ready late morning soon gave us confidence.Rooms on the fifth floor were clean bright and comfortable. Theres a new wi-fi flat screen with TV radio computer etc but we didnt have time to play with toys.The music in the bar late night was mellow drinks expensive as ever but we only had one.Breakfast was very pleasant service good and a good choice of cooked breakfasts cooked to order not a buffet. There were comlimentary newspapers too. A nice touch.The only slightly negative point is that the hotel is a good half mile from any Underground station; useful to know if walking is a problem.
35-49,MALE,Very nice We enjoyed our stay in this hotel.Our children enjoyed riding bicycles and playing in the pool. The kids club was quite nice also.We had a one-bedroom apartment which was very nice for our family. More space than a regular hotel room. The room and the grounds were very clean.The breakfast buffet was very nice also.The staff is quite friendly.The evening buffet was a bit expensive so we went to the Novotel Tanjung Benoa for their evening buffet its a bit less expensive. We enjoy the Novotel food all over Indonesia.This location has a bit different feel than the other Novotel resorts in Indonesia since it has apartments. Its a bit less ethnic / exotic in its feeling and atmosphere.
35-49,MALE,Good Business Hotel This is a mega-convention type business hotel connected to a shopping mall and Hynes convention center. Rooms are pretty good standard Sheraton. Nice furnishings TV bedding linens. They need to do some work on the bathrooms. Most fixtures and tile are dated though they have the newer Speakman shower heads. Pretty good views at this tower hotel too.They have a decent indoor pool with an outdoor deck chair area. The gym may be a bit small for the size of the property - it may be tough to get a treadmill during peak a.m. hours.One big plus this hotel is a short walk to Newbury Street area with many unique dining and shopping options. Of course you can also hit the mall for your standard chain stores if that suits.

65-XX,MALE,An outstanding value: Service in a Grand Style We Mom Dad and teenage daughter arrived at the ANA on the Friendly Bus from Narita tired from our overly long plane ride. As we left the bus various ANA staffers took our bags ushered us to reservations and helped us to our rooms. No tipping necessary. The ANA staff offers service the likes of which most 5 star American Hotels can only aspire to. The staff tries to anticipate your needs and respond accordingly. We also stayed at the ANA in Kyoto. Another great experience. You will not be disappointed by the rooms service or staff. Price was a value compared to most costs in Japan.
35-49,FEMALE,Nice stay at the Drake We stayed at the Drake 12/29-1/1/08. The location is wonderful. We took the Bart train over from the Oakland airport and the Bart station was just down the hill. The cable car to Fishermans Wharf stops right in front of the hotel. If you come to shop Union Square is where you want to stay. The room was clean and the bed was the best hotel bed I have ever slept in. We arrived early and our room was ready. There were 6 elevators and they moved quickly. The only bad things I can think of were the limited TV channels and the dirty window. We will stay at the Drake on our next visit.
25-34,MALE,Great Stay; Near the Airport I was in San Juan on business. The room was clean and comfortable. The toilet backed up on my second day there but I reported it on my way out in the morning and it was repaired before I returned in the evening. Parking is expensive $14/day but its a covered parking deck which is nice considering the heat. Theres a very good complimentary hot breakfast every morning including an omellete bar as well as a managers reception every night where guests get two complementary drinks. The drive to the airport is less than five minutes but I didnt hear any overhead air traffic while I was inside the hotel.This was my second stay at the Embassy Suites San Juan and it will be my first choice the next time I find myself in Puerto Rico.
35-49,FEMALE,Great location romantic hotel easy to reach cruise terminal We stayed at this hotel before our meditaranean cruise. It was well located as we caught the bus from the airport to Piazzale Roma and only had to walk a short distance to the hotel. Then when we went to the cruise terminal we could either catch the shuttle bus - 5 mins from the Piazzale or walk 20 mins.We picked the hotel based on location and did not have expectations of the hotel. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel was exceptional the room we stayed in the superior room top floor overlooked the grand canal and was beautifully furnished. The staff were exceptionally helpful. Breakfast was lovely and served on their sunny terrace.We wouldnt hesitate recommending this romantic hotel to anyone.
50-64,FEMALE,Dissapointed Just returned from a weekend in Florence and booked this 4star hotel we were bitterly disappointed we were expecting a good hotel the reception was great but thats were it stopped the rooms were dark dismal we only had a small window near the ceiling bathrooms were small dark we booked breakfast in the hotel at 15euro each it was very overpriced would certainly not recommend to friends and wouldnt go back to this hotel. Very expensive.
35-49,FEMALE,Feels like home.... Just returned from a 6 night stay at Hostal Adriano. The staff was very helpful the room was spotlessly clean with a silent airconditioner. The room was immaculately cleaned and towels and sheets changed. The tiny bathroom did not bother me at all. It was clean plenty of hot water and shampoo and soap supplied. The area around the hostal is full of shops fashion chains and very good nightlife.The hostal is easily accessed by metro but surely would recommend Aerocity to and from the airport. I would surely recommend this hostal to my friends.
65-XX,MALE,Hits all the right buttons Arrived to find we had been upgraded to the Club section a very pleasent surprise. The room was large and airy with a very good bathroom/dressing section extremely comfortable king bed and comprehensively appointed. There was a small sitting area with sofa and chairs next to a balcony - and this was the only downside. Other reviews of the Handlery have mentioned street noise - and our room overlooked OFarrell Street. Take heed - it is noisy but sleep is easy with earplugs and this small problem should not put anyone off this excellent hotel. You can bet all the other hotels which are as convenient as this suffer the same problem We were only there for three days but found the Daily Grill filled all our needs and those of a lot of locals always a good sign. Friendly and courteous staff made for a great break - would return here any time.
25-34,FEMALE,Gross My boyfriend and I stayed here for 7 days...and by day 2 we were ready to leave The beach itself is AMAZING one of the nicest beaches we have ever been to. However the hotel is the most disgusting trashy hotel I have ever stepped foot in. It is worse than an Econo Lodge. The rooms are dirty and gross. The staff acts like they do not understand English. The line to check in/out was chaos. The food was THE WORST I have ever tasted. I honestly lost about 6 pounds that week. The buffets have flies and birds all over the food. It was the dirtiest thing I have ever seen. The only restaurant with OK food was the Mexican and we did not even discover that until the last night. Please please please if you are at all classy and enjoy good food/service do yourself a favor and do not book this hotel
50-64,FEMALE,Lovely hotel great staff Our family booked three rooms for a one night stay at the Aqua Coconut Waikiki. If we hadnt already made prior arrangements for a condo we would have loved to have stayed longer. They did a great job with the recent renovation. The look is fresh modern sleek and clean. Even the smallish bathroom is renovated to maximize the use of space and light so you feel like its much larger than it actually is. The bed was probably the most comfortable Ive slept in for awhile. But what really sets this hotel apart is the staff. They are all warm friendly and helpful - from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff we encountered in the halls and elevators. They truly exemplify the spirit of Aloha.
50-64,FEMALE,Great stay at the Chancellor We stayed at the Chancellor for five nights in October as our younger sister and friend were running in the Nike Womens Marathon. The location of the hotel was excellent...Nike Village was set up in Union Square as was the start line. Even though the hotel was booked solid probably due to the Oracle conference as well our request of adjoining rooms was granted. All the staff we had contact with were so friendly and helpful. The free use of the computer was welcomed as we were able to do web check-in. Our rooms were great and we loved the pillow menu...also the fact the blanket was in between two sheets. We had breakfast most days in the hotel restaurant and it was very good food and service. Our only disappointment was that we did not get a chance to meet Wes Tyler...our shuttle arrived before he could get to the lobby. Oh well maybe next time... if we return to San Francisco we will definately stay at the Chancellor.
50-64,MALE,Well Above Average I chose this hotel after reading reviews by fellow travellers.Converted to a hotel in 2004 the building has had a varied past and narrowly missed destruction in 1945.The location is fairly central and quiet within easy access of transport and walking distance of most sites.We ate in the restaurant trying the buffet which was excellent value.As mentiones by another reviewer the Italian nearby is worth a visit.The breakfast selection is probably the most varied I have seen and should suit everyone.Helpful staff was also a bonus well done.
35-49,MALE,Good location and standard Me and my wife we stayed at Hotel Catedral 4 night during our trip in Mexico. It was our first hotel in Mexico after 12 hours flight from Europe. Ive red some reviews before and booked this directly via email. We had double room for 660 peso including breakfast. At check-in I asked for quiet room - and I got this. The breakfast is very good but you dont have to pay in advance. It is even better to pay separately because you can save a few dollars and have more choices.The hotel is located in the city center just behind the Zocalo and Cathedral. There are many shops around even second-hand bookshops on the same street and some restaurants too. From airport we drove by taxi 127 peso around 05 hour. It is pretty close to Metro stations Zocalo or Allende - for just 2 peso you can travel acroos whole Ciudad de Mexico.We were satisfied with this hotel and can recommend to other guests.
35-49,MALE,Great for Business not so much as a tourist even though location is great Ive stayed in this hotel numerous times over the years for business and find that its wonderfully accomodating for the business person. The conference facilities are great for the 50 or so folks Ive had the pleasure of working with during our stay here. Its always felt a bit strange to have to walk under the street to get to the conference facilities but thats probably just me.Internet access and a high degree of cleanliness and helpful staff for all sorts of one-off requests during our business meetings always makes me feel comfortable during my stays here. For business in Amsterdam centrally located and close to anything else one might be interested in doing to augment their stay in Amsterdam this hotel is highly recommended.One odd comment overheard on a recent trip was How can this be a 5 star hotel if the bar doesnt open until 1700?. I dont know the answer but that is a very strange aspect of the place. The bar is however wonderful when opened if a bit expensive.Otherwise another great stay The management of this hotel are doing a great job.
25-34,FEMALE,Better than expected My experience at this hotel was much better than I expected. I had read a few bad reviews about this hotel before I went on holiday and I was expecting the worse but it was excellent. Nice welcoming reception friendlyhelpful staff clean tidy room powerful shower good room facilities hairdryer t.v etc. I would describe the room as a typical british travelodge room. nothing posh but standard. I would recommend any one staying here and I would feel confident returning to this hotel. It is also a great location - pretty central but not on a busy street and it is nice to walk outside the hotel straight onto a canal. We didnt have breakfast as we thought the price was pretty steep at 16 Euros and there were plenty of places around serving breakfast anyway.
25-34,MALE,Excellent hotel in a perfect location Bed from other angle looking toward dressing area and bathroom
65-XX,FEMALE,Very Good Value Booked through Hotwire and paid $60/night including all taxes and fees for a large room with two queen beds and wi-fi. I did call and confirm directly with the motel after booking that our room was non-smoking and had two beds rather than hope they got the Hotwire order correct. Plenty of parking. Desk clerk was very helpful at check-in. Room was clean but spartan beds were comfortable but not exceptional. Plenty of hot water. Pool was very clean and inviting but we did not swim. Breakfast was plentiful hard-boiled eggs juice milk coffee fruit biscuits pasteries yogurt but again not exceptional. Overall an excellent value for the area.
65-XX,MALE,Loved the Hyatt Regency We have stayed at this hotel many times over the last few years and have always enjoyed our stays. My wife and I live in the Florida Keys and we find it convenient to spend the night in Miami when we are attending a sporting event or concert.The Hyatt is perfectly located in downtown Miami right on the Miami River where the river empties into Biscayne Bay. If you are in Miami for business or pleasure and need to have access to the downtown area and government centers this hotel is for you.The Knight Center a convention center and concert venue is located in the same building as the Hyatt. Miamis Metro-Mover a clean and modern public transportation system which takes you to all the major government centers sport and concert venues in downtown Miami has a station adjoining the Hyatt.The rooms are recently refurbished spacious modern and clean. Many of the rooms have views of the Miami River or Biscayne Bay. This hotel has all the services and amenities you would expect in a 4 star business hotel and deserves all 4 stars.
35-49,FEMALE,Average hotel at a great price My husband and I styed at the Intercontinental on what may have been the hottest Friday of the season for San Francisco 6/20. The hotel staff is friendly but no more so than any other upscale hotel in the city. The hotel is located across the street from the Museum of Modern Art yet no mention was made of the Frida Kahlo show going on there. It wasnt until we were leaving the city that I realized the show was even there. I would expect more from a hotel that normally charges so much and is RIGHT ACROSS from the museum. I got a screamin deal from Hotwire though and would stay there again if I were able to get another such deal $129/night.
25-34,MALE,Luxurious glamorous and fabulous More photos
18-24,MALE,Fantastic We booked this travel as a last minute so we have been ready for some troubles. But the place suprised us very well Its lovely place with great staff who really cares about your needs. Its serously great place to go for week relax
18-24,FEMALE,LOVED ITTTTT The Hotel was amazing We stayied there for our honeymoon and totally loved itThe staff did everything they could to accomodate us. We stayied there for a total of 11 nights. They were the only hotel to offer breakfast FOR FREE The rooms where beautiful comfortable and CLEAN a little small but perfect Every room had a balcony and even if you booked the partial oceanview it seemed like you got the ocean frontThe pool is a little small but the beach is a 20 second walk.I would def. go back any day
35-49,FEMALE,Not bad for the $$$..... Just got back from New Orleans yesterday and stayed 5 nights at this hotel. Purchased on Hotwire for about $60/night which was about what it was worth. When we first arrived we couldnt decide if it was charming or a dump. Yes there was peeling wallpaper burn marks on the blankets in our non-smoking room and a microwave circa. 1983 however it didnt smell and we finally decided that the room was decent especially for the price. The close quarters make for a lot of outdoor noise with people coming and going all-hours of the night. Here are some tips/recommendations to make sure you have a plesant stay:1. Call ahead like 2-3 weeks to request a particular room. I called 2+ weeks in advance to reserve a room with two double beds. We did end up with a loft-style room which worked out well. I was given a confirmation number when I called to request so make sure to ask for one2. Request a quiet room AWAY from the ice machine and the area where they set up for their breakfast. It was VERY noisy around 7:15am when they were gettting ice and putting up tables for the breakfast crowd. I would suggest something toward the backside of the building. and bring earplugs just in case.....especially if youre a light sleeper3. Dont plan on eating anything worthwhile at the continental breakfast. Its pretty worthless. However there are a few places 1-2 blocks away that serve breakfast Le Madeline Wendys Dunkin Donuts etc.4. We did NOT have to pay for parking in their lot There is quite a bit of on-street parking anyway....not a big deal.5. The location was great It is NOT a bad neighborhood at all It is 1/2 a block from St. Charles and 1 block from the streetcar stop. Emrils Delmonico restaurant is 2 blocks away....and there are several other restaurants nearby as well. There is also a Walgreens 2 blocks away.6. The staff preformed their duties. They definitely didnt bend over backwards for us but were plesant in the few time we dealt with them.Go with few expectations and you will enjoy this hotel. For the price and with what I know now I would definitely stay here again. However just remember....it aint the Ritz :-
35-49,MALE,Fantastic stay great people. We staid here for 6 days and it was fantastic. The rooms were super-clean the shower was great the beds really comfy and the location perfect. Surrounded by a huge variety of nice restaurants and only about 5 minutes walk from Victoria Coach station where you can get a bus coach underground or taxi.
50-64,FEMALE,Lived up to it reputation Checked the reviews for this hotel before booking a last minute long weekend in New York and wasnt disappointed.Great location - within walking distance of the sights but in a quiet area. Bar frequented by locals and there are delis pharmacies etc. on the doorstep.Studio room for three of us was spacious clean quiet and functional. Online Concierge service useful to book transport pillows etc before arriving. Dont book a car back as it is much cheaper - $50 cheaper to get a taxi from outside the hotel.Will definitely book again.
50-64,FEMALE,Great Value in Waikiki We stayed 16 nights in the Diamond Tower-we booked the ocean view hotel room-the room was small and clean with an outstanding ocean view between the hotels in front of us-We have stayed here before in the Pali Tower Kitchenette Room-The Diamond Tower is less noisy and will definately stay here again-This hotel to me is such a bargain for those who want a simple room to sleep in-if you are fussy and want alot of amenities this hotel is not for you. I used to be a travel agent and after comparing many hotels at varying prices I really think the Castle Ocean Resort is a huge bargain. Our room only had a refridgerator so if you want more I would suggest staying in the Pali Tower.It is a3-5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach-on the side by the Zoo-there is an enclosed area that is great for families with children-Hope this helps-I know there are some bad reviews for this hotel but youll get none from me-Aloha
25-34,MALE,guilt-free luxury as a frequent traveler to the big apple stayed at a lengthy list of midtown accomodations. this however would be my first trip to nyc where i would be paying the bill rather than using the corporate charge. although swiping my own plastic i refused to forgo my usual comforts; because when it comes to hotels in new york city there are certain things that are simply essential luxury and location and others that are completely implausible space and silence.i chose hotel mela because of its 4-star rating and since i was on a mission to find the perfect party dress its proximity to great shopping check. beyond that the price was unbeatable. i was visiting the city during fashion week the u.s. open so rooms were scarce and prices were fierce. hotel mela was the only luxury hotel with an available room for less than $400 a night. i could barely believe it myselfupon arrival i was pleasantly suprised by the tasteful decor friendly staffers and comfortable although teeny quarters. i also adored the modern crimson lobby the french-vietnamese restaurant and flat screen lcd in my room. hotel mela can rival the swankiness of the paramount or hudson but at a fraction of the cost. so for a chic midtown experience with an extra bill in your pocket for broadway or babbo you can pick up the tab at hotel mela with a smile.--blogger dtpost
65-XX,FEMALE,Love Puerto Rico ESJ a good enough choice Traded our Florida timeshare for the 2nd time in about 5 years to ESJ our 3rd trip to PR. We like PR because it is a Real Place with historyvariety of landscapes and friendly proud people not just built for tourists. Everywhere we went including villages looked fairly well maintained and prosperous.This time our unit #553 was like a hotel room with a small kitchen apt. range sink full refrig microwave dishes for 4 Last time we had more space but in sight and sound of nearby airport. This time balcony overlooked ocean; well actually rooftops and very noisy service area but wide ocean view beyond.Double beds lots of bamboo furniture with many drawers. Room had new looking blue/green pattern carpeting peach colored walls tropic colored bedspreads and drapes. Table and chairs for 4. As exchangers we had no maid service which suited us fine. Bathroom had separate bath and toilet space large sink and vanity space with closet and adequate hangers. Small soaps extra tissue. Paper towels and dish cloth thingy in kitchen but no detergent.Not much contact with personnel but what we had was efficient and pleasant. Key cards did not always work for access doors to beach and pool. Watch that tricky gate to beach. Have to set it just right punch in numbers and move quickly. I and many others got caught in between like a monkey in a cage and had to wait for assistance but got used to it. Beach beautiful and long around the coast great for walking and sunning but not many people using it for swimming except on a holiday while we were there lots of local families..Before we went to Luquillo Beach along the coast to the east famous and beautiful but we did not get there this timeWe senior citizens enjoyed just sitting on beach reading chairs $2.14 daily towels free and sitting around the pool. Rented Corolla from Hertz found out at last minute that our home insurance did not cover PR so had to buy expensive insurance; therefore we felt obligated to make good use of the car. Went to El Yunque rain forest one day our 3rd time but they have built a really nice visitors center since last time with exhibits and facilities. We drove only as far as the tower and climbed up for the view did not penetrate any farther. Lovely weather all the time we were there this week 84 degrees and very little rain. Drove into Old San Juan finally found parking garage. OUr car was equipped with GPS and we really used it but not always understandable in city and mountain villages with one way streets and detours. Traffic seems much much heavier than our last trip. Roads are good and well marked but lots of traffic and delays even on the four lanes. We walked the usual tourist route El Morro etc in Old San Juan had lunch near the cathedral.Husb wanted to drive into the mountainous interior. From an article in Que Pasa maga zine we chose Barranquitas with lunch stop in Aibonito and programmed car to take us by scenic mountain routes. It was that all right round and round and up and down good well marked roads but narrow and curving. Beautiful scenery of mountains. Had lunch at Aibonito and returned did not make it to Barq.As previous reviews we returned nearly every night to our fav restaurant Mi Casita also ate at Chilis across street from ESJ entrance gate. Minimarket in ESJ is well supplied but expensive. We bought breakfast supplies. There is a grocery store next door to Mi Casita. El San Juan resort and casino next door was a Wyndam property last trip. Expensive restaurants which we did not use this time. Casino took our money and did not pay off as well as last time so did not spend as much time there. Seems to have been ritzier and dressier when it was a Wyndam.
65-XX,MALE,Great Location I have been using this hotel for at least 25 years - the manager Don Julian has been there forever and he always recognises my wife and me The street has recently been pedestrianized but taxis are permitted to enter the street to leave hotel guests although some do not realise this and will leave their passengers by the Metro exit on Puerto del Sol - this means a walk of 30 meters to the hotel entrance. Well worth it The breakfasts are superb.
50-64,MALE,Great Value Very Nice Hotel Clean I stayed 4 nights recently for a business trip. The hotel is centrally located right on Ala Wai Blvd and Kaiulani Ave--it is next to some older low-rise apartments NOT crack houses and only a 150 yards from Kuhio Ave which is one the main streets of Waikiki. I had room 1207 which was a standard room on the 12th floor right behind the elevator shaft. The room had a single and queen size bed and a small desk. The bath was adequate the carpet was excellent and the room was very clean. The linens were also more than adequate. The furnishings were in very good to excellent condition. There was a Panasonic TV and a nice size refrigerator. The rooms have a small safe with Medeco high security locks no charge. Overall I was very pleased with the room. The only negative for the room was that it was noisy. One reason is no fault of the hotel--Ala Wai Blvd is main street out of Waikiki and Waikiki itself is a densely packed and noisy environment. The other factor is that the elevator shaft was right behind the wall of this room and every time the elevators moved you could hear the noise elevators. The parking valets were extremely friendly and really hustled. The normal parking rate is $15/day but I got it for $7.50 by making my reservations through AAA. This is cheap parking for Waikiki. I dont drink so I cant comment on the bar. I did try the fish and chips from the menu though. It was $8.95 and was excellent. The food prices were very reasonable for Waikiki--I dont know who thought the prices were expensive. The hotel had a lot of Japanese tourists and caters to this clientele. There is a food service in the lobby that makes bento boxes for the Japanese crowd--I didnt try them but given that the proprietors were from Japan the bento lunches looked very appetizing and authentic. The Hospitality room had 6 computers and I used them to check my email and surf the web. The pool was large and very nice but I did not use it. The continental breakfast was served at poolside from 6:30-9am. This was very basic with coffee cereal toast bagels and donuts and some kind of juice. There might have been a few other items as well. This was the only disappointing aspect of the hotel. Overall the public areas of the hotel were very clean and well maintained and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Since the hotel breakfast wasnt appealing you can walk to several restaurants within 2-5 minutes. There is a great restaurant 150 yards away in the Ohana West Hotel which offers fast and reasonable meals. Just a half a block away is an ABC Stores--its like an upscale 7-Eleven and they are everywhere on the islands. The hotel is centrally located and close to the beach or if you are driving as you exit the hotel youre right on Ala Wai Blvd with takes you out of Waikiki. Best of all the average cost per night for my 4 nights one weekend night including tax was only $97 This hotel wasnt luxurious but it was clean and comfortable the staff was friendly and the price was more than reasonable. I will definitely stay there again when visiting Honolulu.
25-34,MALE,Amazing Honeymoon We stayed for 5 nights at Secrets Excellence. Let me start by saying Im sorry the review is coming so late. Before booking our honeymoon I read several reviews and this resort was reviewed well. Right after booking our honeymoon the resort began to receive bad reviews; you can imagine my fiance and I were a little nervous. We had nothing to be nervious about. We got off the plane at the grass hut style airport. It was so cool we were greeted by singers and dancers. They even take a picture with some local ladies and try to sell it to you later. The ride to our hotel was a little long and bumpy but nothing you cant manage. Its worth the ride to get to the resort. Just try to enjoy the scenery and do not pay attention to the driving. When we arrived at the resort they took our luggage from taxi and we didnt touch it again until we unpacked it in our room. We paid the extra money for the Excellence Club. We enjoyed it and it was a great added bonus since we were on our honeymoon. If we go back we probably wouldnt pay the extra again; but I dont regret doing it once. We stayed in an ocean view suite. The rooms are very nice. Everything is marble. Dont pay the money for a swimout suite. You really arent that close to the pool. We were so glad we didnt after we saw how far the door was from the pool. Also if you book an ocean view room make sure you request 2nd or 3rd floor. If you are on the 1st floor you cant see the ocean well because of all of the landscape. The food was great. We tried all the restaurants excecpt the asian food. Our favorite was probably the steak house. The seafood was good also. Bourdeaux was nice but not our favorite. You have to keep an open mind though. Things are seasoned differently there--be bold branch out and try something new. We stayed on the beach a lot and didnt do a lot of the organized activities. Lunch on the beach is great dont miss it. We were there to relax so we didnt really participate in the organized activies. We did take a half day snorkeling trip. We were able to swim with shark and stingray. It was unreal. I suggest you try it. We went to the shows each night. They arent vegas but they are still fun. Like I said earlier keep and open mind and drink lots of coco-locos. Those are the best drinks ever. The drinks were great and they flowed freely. We would be lounging by the pool and people would constantly keep your drink fresh. We had an excellent stay. We want to go back for an aniversery. So when you see a bad review over look it and look forward to your trip. We used allinclusiveoutlet.com to book our trip
35-49,MALE,Worst price/quality ratio I ever experienced Dear TravellerI stayed in this hotel from 26th September to 1st October 2006 for attending a nearby conference and continuing with a weekend holiday.The entire room was run down. Everything appeared to be heavily used not meaning to have a nice glance of patina. The bathroom was tiny with almost no room to turn around. Funnily the wardrobe was tiny too so that it did not close with my jackets on a hanger I am not big actually. The TV was ridiculously small and old that I never turned it on. The quality standard of the interior in general was just mediocre maybe. The room faced a street the traffic of which woke me up early as I slept with open windows. Positive about the room was that I had a separate dressing room. The breakfast I tried once at the weekend was quite typical for southern European countries meaning modest but acceptable but nothing to be compared with the standards of international chains. The night porter snapped at me as if I was a foreigner when I woke him up at 4 am although he checked me in and saw me several times it is a small hotel indeed. The cleaners banged at my door at 9 am on two days despite the fact that I left my key in the lock do not disturb signs were not available. The other personnel behaved alright though. The waiters at breakfast were very kind indeed.The room was worth at most 80 Euros a night even taking into account high prices in Florence. I should have complained about the room but simply accepted it because I wrongly remembered my room rate to be about 120 Euros; it was above 180 Euros eventually. That was my fault indeed.My colleagues I travelled with got much nicer hotels newly refurbished rooms excellent breakfast and central as well for a much lower price less than 130 Euros.I recommend to all travellers to avoid this hotel unless you exactly know the room beforehand. As it could be a jewel hopefully the owners spend some money in refurbishing the rooms.Regards
25-34,FEMALE,Wunderful stay in a great hotel We stayed two days in this hotel for touristic reasons. We wanted to look around in Berlin however we were here two yers ago we stayed in the same hotel that time as well. We liked this place so much that we did not search for any other accomodation this time. We found an advantageous two days arrangement on the website which included breakfast it was not a question whether to stay anywhere else.The rooms are spacoious clean and has nice warm colours. The location is perfect for touristic and for business trips as well. The hotel is very nice the staff is very kind you will find even the finest details perfect here free internet access freshly made limonade in the lobby. Dont miss the breakfast it is awesome. Have a nice stay at this hotel
50-64,FEMALE,Great Place For Families Great hotel for tourist travel to DC particularly with kids. Very family friendly. We were there for a week this June and found it to be a perfect location to see all the sights. We took cabs to the museums from the hotel and never paid more than $13 for the trip with two per day that comes to the same price as parking a car at the hotel. The included breakfast every morning is tasty and extensive and my son loved the managers reception every evening for snacks. I also cant say enough positive things about the staff. They were friendly and helpful with directions flagging down cabs and keeping the rooms and the grounds clean. The biggest downside to our stay is that we appeared to be there during school field trip season so there were large swarms of somewhat unsupervised kids using the public areas. While this is a downside it is certainly not the fault of the hotel. The Itallian restaurant in the hotel was very good and there are a number of other restaurant options in easy walking distance of the hotel through nice neighborhoods including a number of embassies. Tip for tired sightseers - there are several local restaurants that will deliver to your room We stretched a tasty Thai dinner out for two days. SInce the rooms are equiped with microwave and refridgerator eating in the room is a reasonable option as well.
65-XX,MALE,Great Hotel Super Staff I have stayed in many hotels in the SF Union Sq area over the past 30 years and the Cartwright is one of the best values I have seen Its older but thoroughly updated has a very passable serve-yourself breakfast cook your own waffles choice of hot and cold cereals yogurts fruit teas Starbucks coffee etc. Rooms are on the small side but mine had a big walk in closet and bathroom with tub/shower good quality toiletries. Free WiFi had a very strong signal even on the 8th floor. Complimentary wine tasting in the library every afternoon. Inexpensive valet or self parking. Very helpful staff Ill definitely stay there in the future
25-34,FEMALE,excellent bargain We stayed at the Bali Mandira two weeks prior to our wedding in Bali. We payed the extra 10 dollars for the upgrade to a deluxe cottage and it was well worth it. The cottage itself was nothing special not a lot of natural light came in so it was quite dark and cold a lot of the time however the bathroom was terrific It was half enclosed half open air so you could stand in a little rockwalled shower with tropical plants surrounding you and look up at the clear blue sky Also included with the upgrade was access to the lounge area which provided soft drinks and cakes free all day long with a happy hour from around 5 to 7 with free cocktails - my husband was in heaven The location is terrific - the beach is separated from the hotel by a pathway however the beach itself was immaculate a big change from the last time we stayed in Legian. Although you are only a short stroll from the main shopping streets the hotel itself is very quiet. The two pools are fantastic particularly the one on the roof top and at nighttime the candles on the tables that surround the other pool from the restaurant give it a really nice ambience. We were so happy with the Mandira we will definitely stay there again.
25-34,FEMALE,Do NOT Have Your Wedding Here Well we found this hotel through long internet searching. We planned for a small beachside destination wedding in Puerto Rico. We both have never been to the island and not sure what to expect. We then found and spoke to the wedding and catering sales manager Marilyn at the Water and Beach Club. There she said not to worry about a permit for they have there own platform and quoted us a price. We were happy to have found a place that seemed to good to be true thats because it was After receiving her rate we sent our contract back to the hotel through air mail. She said that the canopy priced increased and because she had not received anything this was the price to set. Ok not happy about that but will get over it. Then THREE weeks before the wedding they tell me they can not do the beach side wedding without a permit. This permit was a non refundable extra $500.00. And still this permit may not have enough time to review and if it was denied we would still lose the $500.00. THIS IS AFTER THE CONTRACT HAD BEEN SIGNED AND ACCEPTED This is very upsetting so close to the date and the worst part was they did not seem sympathetic at all or offer any compensation. After settling for the site on their terrace I ask for some compensation. After a week of not hearing anything from them even after multiple emails and messages. I call the GM and he does not offer anything we had to demand a free stay at there hotel for failing to live up to their contract. This was a small feat at which should have been easy for them to arrange and still that was a struggle. The worst is yet to come. When we arrive THE DAY OF Marilyn says the seating arrangement we had would not be able to comfortable seat the people we had in its original spot. So she offers 3 other sites within the hotel. After we choose another alternative she then says we can not have the space due to THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE PAYING PATRONS USE THE SITE FOR MASSAGES Then after expressing my distaste in this hotel she says that I may use that site for an additional 250 charge. This hotel does not care at all about the thoughts and feelings of there guests A wedding is a special event and should be treated as so. Yet massages for other guest were more important then my dinner reception. These people falied to first know the limitations of their beach permits then treat me like it didnt matter to them how we felt about the situation. Not even to offer something to ease the situation. Even the GM did not give any consolation. I felt as if they cared only for the money they previously received and since they knew we couldnt leave after such short notice and took full advantage of that. DO NOT use this hotel
25-34,MALE,fantastic location I stayed for 4 nights at this hotel The whole hotel was immaculate and the staff courteous and professional. The room was well equipped very grateful for the air conditioning and everything in the room worked.The bathroom was very small shower only but was well decorated and everything was in full working order.The location could not have been better about 3 mins walk from centraal station and practically on the Dam.I did not eat in the restaurant but please do not take this as a criticism I just didnt get round to it. Every time I walked past the restaurant at any time of day it was either full or very nearly full which as a hotel manager in the UK I know is the sign of a very very good restaurantIn summary a very well run hotel clean well presented with a good restaurant going on number of diners. My only criticism and it is very minor indeed is that the welcome from some of the staff was very polite and courteous but felt a little mechanical and not too genuine. However do not let this put you off The Roode Leeuw is very very good
35-49,MALE,Would not go back We are big fans of all inclusive resorts and have stayed in all inclusives in Cancun Mexico 1/2 dozen times. Those resorts were consderred 5-6 stars. So when you read this review keep in mind what our frame of reference is.PROPERTY: The property is very nice with a nice private beach area. Depending on where your room is you could be in for a lot of walking. The walkway between hotels is covered but at the time of year we went it made no difference as it was hot and humid. The beach is on one end of the hotel and most of the dining/activity is on the other end of the hotel. Its like a big rectangular layout with a meanering pool running the length of the layout. There are no elevators at the individual buildings that house the hotel rooms. ROOMS: We had a deluxe junior suite. The rooms are tiny. The smallest I have ever seen Additionally the air conditioning would barely keep the room cool even if you ran it 24/7 IN CONJUNCTION with running the ceiling fan on high speed. The air conditioning intake filter was packed with about 1/2 inch of dirt/lint etc. Apparently it was not just our room that was like this and maintenance seems to replace the filters only when its brought to their attention. We were in a group of 14 people and everyones rooms had the same air conditioning issues some worse than others depending on the floor of the building. When you are out in the blazing heat all day and cannot even come to your room for a break its quite disappointing. We also had a red ant infestation that seemed to have been created by the sugar near the coffee maker either prior guests or room not properly cleaned.SERVICE: The service here was deplorable. From the rooms the bars to the pool side service to the diniing rooms buffet or non buffet. A few examples....At the main pool cabana where towels are given out at 9:45 a.m. one morning they had no towels In the rooms we often were left with no floor towel without ANY face towels less bath towels etc. At the bars ANY of them and we frequented ALL of them they are understaffed and unfriendly unattentive and very slow. It seemed that unless you were greasing the staff with wads of cash in advance of receiving your drink service was not forthcoming. In the dining rooms silverware would often be missing and take forever to get. Asking for a drink or a refill of water was another issue. We are used to the staff somethering us asking if we need something and here you ask and ask and ask and finally get what you need when the meal is over. They seem to be able to habdle the buffet breakfast best. Pool side- there is usually 1 person covering a very large area and as a result your drink will take 10-15 minutes if its early and if its peak time figure 1/2 hour.DINING/FOOD: Food was acceptable. The variety was not impressive over a 6 day stay and the quality was so-so. One plus is that if you want to eat at a fancier restaurant you do not need to make reservations unless you are in a large group. We went to the 4 out of the 5 restaurants and would recommend the French and Japanese ones the most. One issue is that you are expected to wear pants in most of the dining areas for the evening with a proper shirt. While this is not a problem in and of itself its a big issue when its still hot as heck outside and the A/C is barely effective or on in the dining areas. Especially in the Japanese restaurant where there are open grills giving off heat.The staff do not seem well trained and do not have the right attiudes either. Also not all of them speak sufficient English so be forewarned.
65-XX,MALE,Great Service and Property We arrive late and unfortunately the hotel did not have our requested two bedded room available but the desk clerk volunteered to get the front desk manager who appologized compensated us with a free dinner in the hotel restaurant and by the time we were through eating our request room was ready.The room was very large with two queen beds and plenty of room to move around plus large desk space large closet large bathroom with tub shower.The place was immaculately maintained and service always very professional and friendly...the even loaned me an umbrella one day and went out of their way with typical tourist questions.An excellent location just a block from Times Square buses subway tour buses and all the conveniences and trappings of this great big beautiful ciy.Definately recommend.
50-64,MALE,Central and superb Superb hotel with a good location in the heart of Berlin.Large clean comfortable and well-equipped room. Efficient and attentive staff.Short stay for business - not even time for breakfast - but I would unhesitatingly return.
25-34,MALE,Great Hotel I stayed with a few friends for the Miami Half Marathon. This hotel is a very easy 10 minute drive from the start of the race. We had a suite with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms and a full kitchen. Everything was very clean checkin and checkout was smooth the free breakfast eaten after the race was excellent. Unfortunately there were some loud guests or pool crashers around 1:30-2:30 AM that interrupted my sleep. I believe that they were kicked off the premises. I cant blame the hotel for this incident.Id gladly stay there again.
65-XX,FEMALE,great views We stayed here before a cruise in 2 rooms 4 adults. Agesfrom 30s to 60s. Excellent location for cruisers you can walk right to pier 67. Lobby and rooms are more forest lodge decor while loungeand restaurant are very modern and interesting. Views from thelounge are great as you are right over the water. For those thatsuffer from mal de mar it could be a problem but then its agood precurser for your cruise.Rooms are small with fireplaces and some have city view whichare fine but not very scenic. Bathrooms are tiny but fully equipped and stylish.Nice amenities in bathrooms. Very clean neat rooms. Service was friendly if not always accurate with information.Its a long uphill walk to restaurants and shopping. Seattle hasgood transportation system though.Be sure to visit the flight museum outside the city.
25-34,FEMALE,Rain or Sun..still alot of fun MY husband and I were at this resort Jan 17-24. With alot of research on the different resorts in Punta Cana we decided to go with this one for many different but one important reason..The reason is and the main reason was it had a bit of everything to offer especially GOLF. My hubbie is addicted to golf and for me all i was interested in was a fab beach. Oh yes not to mention the price was right as wellWe had a great flight from toronto. We left the cold and the best feeling ever was walking out of the plane in Punta Cana to feel the warmth. Got through the airport smoothly and off we were to find the bus to take us to the resort. That had to be the most confusing thing ever We were told atleast 3 different numbers for the buses and they are all numbered. Each bus for eachresort. Finally we got to the bus and went on. All the other buses were leaving and there we were sitting there with no idea as to why we have not left. Long story short...I still dont know to this daybut lets jsut say it took much longer then it should have. Finally we were on our way. Its a very short bus ride to the resort. Upon arrival to this resort I was completely impressed with the open bright lobby We checked in and within 10 minutes we got our keys to our room. The staff took our bags and placed them into the cart. I WAS SHOCKED that they took our bags but hey what about us? Where is our room? Oh yes one thing I did not like was the fact we had to attempt to find our room on our own. It was interesting to find our villa as I forgot to m ention that we arrived late night. The resort is brightly lit however if u dont know where u r going it can be a fraustrating why to start off. FINALLY got to our room 3127. Walked in and once again I was shocked to see the state of the room...one word to explain the room...PERFECT Very brightlarge and most importuntly CLEAN The shower and the toilet where in the same room and the 2 sitter bathtub was on the otherside from where the shower was. I was super excited to see how nice the rooms were as the other half and I have had some horrible experiences in the past. We decided to drop our things and make our way through the resort to see whats where and find something to eat. No problems th hubbie found some hotdogs and we then found the casino. Lets just say we were not so lucky to win anything.To get to the point of my thoughts of this resort I will list everything good and bad briefly:**PRO***-Clean and spacious rooms-A ceiling fan to keep u extreamly cool and comfy-Fab and clean beach with tons of chairs. To get a hutmust go super early to place ur towels downs. Not a big deal if u dont get onevery breezy cominbg from the beautiful blue ocean-Swimming pool another beautylarge and veryy clean. Lots of chairs so there is no issue. The bar is near by and does not take long to get a cold drink-We had some rain durning our trip and was stuck under a tent by the pool to keep dry. The staff were thereready to get the party started regardless of the weatgher. This is loved the most. -Pool side restaurant..AMAZING The best pizza everall the sodas and beer u wish to have. All u can eat at this place..try the icecream one thing I did not but heard its great-U have choices between 4 different restaurants which unfortuntly we did not go as the main reason is I AM A PICKY EATER. We did eat every day breakfast dinner. I am notsure if there can possibly be anyother person out there as picky as I am...so dont worry about the buffet. U forsure will find something to your liking-the grounds of the resort was sooooo clean and inviting-majority of the staff were always smiling and saying hello. The odd ones some interesting personalities if I can put it that wayWell as u can see no cons to right. I highly recommend this resort. Remember u go with a positive attitude something good always comes ur way. U go negitive well then u mine have well stayed home to complain
25-34,FEMALE,Absolutely fantastic My new husband and I had the opportunity to stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village for our honeymoon from January 5th through the 12th of this year. I must say after reading some of the reviews on this resort I was extremely anxious to arrive to either confirm or deny the comments of other travelers. I am happy to report that our stay at the resort was met with pure optimism and an amazing experience.We arrived at the Hilton late in the evening on a Saturday after a long flight from New Jersey. My parents are Hilton Grand Vacation Club members and were gracious enough to give us their timeshare for our honeymoon as a wedding present. Therefore we stayed in the Lagoon Tower. When we got off the shuttle our bags were taken immediately to our hotel room without hesitation nor pressure to be tipped. We were guided to our tower and immediately checked in without any problems. I had heard on this site that the resort was currently under construction in certain areas which is true. However we were lucky to be placed in a room on the 14th floor facing the lagoon and the ocean. We had a fantastic view from our room where we were able to see almost the entire resort as well as the water. The room was very clean as well as the balcony. My only complaint concerning the room was the bathroom where I was expecting a separate tub and shower after staying in other 1 bedroom condos through Hilton in the past. However this is not a necessity.The places to eat in the resort can be very expensive. However with the location of the Hilton being in the midst of Waikiki dining options are endless outside of the resort. I would recommend dining at Bali at the Sea in the Hilton due to the quality of both the service as well as the food. It isnt cheap but if you go at 6pm Monday through Thursday ask for the Sunset Dinner Special where you receive a special menu with dining entrees at a reduced price. As for the resort itself it has absolute character and appeal. I found it to be absolutely beautiful whether you were at the beach or on the sidewalk on Kalia Rd. The service was fantastic. We were always greeted whether we were arriving or leaving our tower in the resort. Questions were always addressed on the spot and handled accordingly. I would definitely recommend this resort for couples despite past reviews saying it is more family oriented. Vacations are what you make out of them. Yes there were families with small children at the resort during our stay but in no way did it hinder our awesome experience.If youre looking for an active honeymoon full of activity as well as relaxation the Hilton Hawaiian Village will provide just that.
50-64,MALE,Luxury Hotel: but dont use the glassware Very large Luxury hotel; however as is the rule now with luxury hotels that provide in-room glassware coffee cups wine and water glasses etc.; Drink out of them at your own risk I routinely work in room during business stays the Moneteleone was no exception. During our stay I routinely watched as the staff cleaned our used room glassware and coffepot by simply rinsing them out in the sink and wiping them down with....yes....our used bathroom towels. This is apparently now a standard sinful practice coming to light in luxury hotels. How to quickly tell if this has happened in your room in this or any hotel? Look at the cleaning carts in the halls; if they do not have trays of sanitary wrapped glassware then you can guarantee the glassware in your room has not been replaced and is instead getting the luxury wipedown. Those glasses may not have seen a dishwasher since they were first placed in the room when the hotel was first built.Will stay there again but will adopt the Motel-6 cleanliness standard and bring my own styrofoam/disposable drinking ware.
25-34,MALE,Stay somewhere else This was the final night of a 28 day trip around Australia and New Zealand and I booked this place to break up the long trip from New Zealand back to the UK.The Good:- Location is good right on the waterfront and if you have a view of the harbour I expect it would be pretty nice although not as good as one of the circular quay hotels such as Four Seasons or the Marriott- Decor is nice and modern with nice colours in the room and a big Id guess 32 TVThe Bad:- Check-in was only manned by one person who was clearly very busy. I checked in and was told to go to my room and given a key. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the room to find two other guests already in there. They were extremely surprised to see me as I was to see them. If I had been them I would have been very angry with someone walking in unannounced - I felt very bad about this.I understand mistakes do happen but I feel this could so easily have been avoided and put a downer on the whole stay at the hotel. The desk clerk was verbally apologetic and I asked him to call the occupants of the first room to apologize.The second room I was given was by far the smallest of all the hotels I stayed at during the trip and was the furthest from reception there was on the 3rd floor. It had a small window which was high up and did not open. This faced the street and had a view of a tiny bit of the road leading to the harbour bridge. The notepad in the room still had the previous guests notes on it.No mention or further apology for the room incident was given at check-out or at any other time during my stay.- I was not met by a porter at the arrival door and had to drag my heavy bags up some stairs to reception and to my rooms- Left luggage is kept behind a roped area right next to the door rather than in a separate secured room as in other hotels. I suppose this is secure if there is a porter watching it permanently but I was still anxious leaving my belongings there.- The other person in my party in another room found a cockroach in their room as they were departing.I would definitely not stay at this hotel again. Earlier on in the trip I stayed at the Marriott Sydney Harbour for a week and this is a fantastic hotel. It is preferable in every respect with far better service an excellent exec lounge excellent views and better service location and rooms.
65-XX,MALE,All we expected from the TripAdvisor reviews We chose Amsterdam for a short post Christmas break and selected this hotel based upon the Tripadvisor reviews. Excellent hosts with obvious pride in ownership very helpful and friendly. Well furnished clean small rooms with little cupboard or draw space but certainly warm enough during a cold spell in January.. Good quality breakfast included in our rate. Location is ideal for the concert hall and other Museum area attractions although a little far from the centre of town unless you use public transport  which is close by.We enjoyed our stay here and I would think this hotel excellent for a short break where you dont expect to spend much time in your room.
35-49,FEMALE,We had a very nice experience at the Inn at the Market We stayed at the Inn at the Market over a long Labor Day weekend. Ive read a lot of mixed reviews on the Inn and all I can say is we had a really nice experience there.Were not big on paying a lot for a view in any hotel room because we just dont spend that much time in our room so we opted for a city view. We were in room 408 and it has a view of the courtyard that you walk through as you enter the hotel. For a view of the water we were very satisfied with simply going up to the 5th floor deck where you had an unlimited view of Elliot Bay Mt. Rainier the waterfront and everything youd see if you had a water view room. We took so many pictures from the deck and just stood there and admired the view. It was a nice place to strike up a conversation with other guests and overall a nice place to escape the hustle of the Market area below.Our room was lovely and spacious and we saw no signs of any of the wear and tear that some reviews have mentioned. The bathroom in our room was the size of a small bedroom And one thing I really loved about the bathroom was the shelving unit available for us to put our bathroom things on. Every hotel should offer this so that you dont have to live completely out of your suitcase or have a thousand things on the back of the toilet simply for them to be handy.The tempurpedic bed got a mixed review. I had no issues with it and found it quite comfortable. My husband...not so much. He would have liked a firmer mattress and he said he felt as if he was sleeping on his head the entire time. Overall though it was fine.We dont normally make a lot of use of concierge services etc. and were not big users of room service either so I cant speak a lot about that. We did order dessert through room service one night and it was very nice. For breakfast we went to the Market Bagel shop over on 1st Ave. about 1/2 block south of the hotel for a very inexpensive breakfast a couple of days. One day we walked a few blocks to a nearby coffee shop no not Starbucks...we avoided corporate coffee Cafe Ladro. VERY good coffee and pastries and worth the 6 or 7 blocks to walk.Dinners were mostly eaten in and around the Market area. We can highly recommend Shiro Sushi again within easy walking distance and it was highly recommended to us by one of the front desk staff. Just a tip: Ivars is so overrated dont waste your time. We live in the Midwest and weve had fish here that was so much better than that Long John Silvers knockoff.The Market area itself is a zoo. If you dont like walking into people/crowds in general youll go nuts here after a couple of days. Granted we were there over a holiday weekend and during the last day of Bumbershoot but even after that ended it was still nuts. It really wasnt the crowds that got to us so much as the buskers annoying with a capital A and basically everywhere you turn and the seemingly endless supply of insane people. That was our biggest takeaway from Seattle: is every third person on the street insane? Not that we ever felt threatened quite the contrary. But we had people just randomly yell at us and everyone else around them hiss at us like a cat skateboard by us singing a song about Chairman Mao...it seemed to never end. I guess you can call it free street theatre.The Inn is in the midst of all this and we were definitely at the heart of all the action. The bell staff was incredibly friendly the front-desk staff was helpful the room was very nice the location was tourism ground zero. Not really sure how we could have improved on the experience. Oh and it was sunny and 68 every day we were there So much for the Seattle drizzle experience Honestly if I had one complaint it would be the TV channel selection. There are about 20 channels half of which are sports the other half local government and news. Boring boring boring. But again we dont go on vacation to watch TV. But if youre looking for something interesting to watch as you fall asleep...good luck to you my friend.If we were going back to Seattle and wanted to stay in the city itself I wouldnt hesitate to go back to Inn at the Market.
65-XX,FEMALE,Excellent Start This hotel was an excellent start to our 2 months of travel in US and Canada. We stayed with them for 3 nights from 4 June and despite it being a large corporate hotel all the staff were very friendly and helpful extra brownie points to the lady in the Gift Shop who doubles as the Concierge for going the extra mile. Our room was large well furnished and well maintained and our pre-travel request of a room high up and overlooking the bay had been granted. We made the mistake of picking up our car at the airport on arrival and thought the hotels car parking charge was unreasonable. We didnt like the polystyrene cups on the drinks tray either but found that they were used by a lot of hotels on our travels. If youre a tea drinker then take your own. Apart from those 2 niggles we enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn Golden Gateway as it was very central and we were able to walk to most places.
35-49,FEMALE,All Expectations Met and Then Some Living Room
35-49,FEMALE,Jan. 2008 trip From Resort lobby
18-24,FEMALE,Fantastic location and good value for money What a great place to stay if youre looking for somewhere in the Back Bay area. Close to transport links including both Back Bay station fifteen minutes walk and the subway Symphony is the closest stop and about five minutes walk this hotel is great if youre looking to save money and see all Boston has to offer.The only disadvantage is that there was no restaurant when we were there so sadly the convenience of BB was out but it does benefit from being close to several restaurants and a mall which all serve great breakfasts Plus a twenty minute walk takes you in the direction of the main shopping area and the common which has a lot of choice.The rooms are clean and decent sized and the staff on reception were friendly. If you want something wallet-friendly then Id give this a shot- dont expect luxury but it certainly is quality.
50-64,MALE,Overall great - modern style room Overall very good. We used the room lobby and garage for a one night stay as tourists in Berlin. We got a room 295 in the renovated section and liked the style and amenities. They have integrated the bathroom and closet in a functional way. The room felt spacious and in addition to the queen ? size bed a desk/chair and one sitting chair. Lots of useable shlf spaces in the room. The tv was small. The room did face Budapester Strasse still the noise was OK even when we opened the window.The checkout was ok - except for a discussion over a charge for a pay for movie we did not watch and the hotel waived the charge. We did hang out for 20 min in the lobby and it is large Id like it to be a bit more cozy.Regarding the booking: we used hotwire to book and then found out rooms in Swissotel highter rated in tripadvisor were available for the same rate.
35-49,MALE,Elegant hotel good service great breakfast location We stayed at the Mark Hopkins for four nights in April and had a very enjoyable stay there all in all. The entrance and lobby of the hotel is elegant. The service at check-in was ok. The receptionist was effective but should have been a bit more attentive and friendly. In general however we were very pleased with the service at the hotel. Many former reviewers have complained about having to wait for a long time for the elevator to arrive. We never experienced this problem however.Our room a deluxe corner room on the eight floor was quite nice and had a good view of the northern part of the city. The difference in size between a classic room and a deluxe room is quite minimal however. My parents-in-law and my brother who also stayed at the hotel stayed in classic rooms. But usually the deluxe rooms have better views than the classic rooms. The bath room was also nice. It included a large tub that our little son enjoyed very much. The knob on the shower however was not in tip-top condition. The night we arrived my wife wanted to take a shower and not being used to that type of knob she pulled it in the wrong direction which resulted in the knob braking. You could clearly see from all the glue inside the knob that this was not the first time this had happened. The front desk immediately sent a plummer to fix the problem however. A negative aspect with the rooms is that they are quite poorly sound isolated as many others have pointed out. We could on a couple of occasions clearly hear which tv program our neighbour was watching. A very nice surprise was that breakfast is served at the Top-of-the-mark a bar on the top of the hotel with a fantastic 360-degree view of the city. The service quality and range of the food being served was also very good. The location of the hotel is in our opinon perfect. Because it is on the top of Nob Hill most rooms have very good views. It takes only five minutes walk to Union Square and Chinatown. There is a nice park  Huntington Park just 50 meters from the hotel and it also has a children`s playground.
25-34,MALE,Loved this hotel beds were so comfy slept so well View from pool area
25-34,MALE,5 star resort with 2 star food We just retuned form Bahia Principe and had a great time. A beautiful looking resort with many things to keep you busy throughout the day and night. I have rencently turned 30 and have travelled all throught the Caribbean and have stayed at mostly 5 star resorts. This could be classified a five star resort if the food was upgraded. The rooms are nice the grounds are beautiful the pools are great and the staff was very helpful and nice but the food has to be changed to get an honest 5 star rating . The two words of the week were OIL and UNDERCOOKED. Everything that is served is undercooked bacon sausage burgers be careful and if it was cooked it was floating in oil. Oil in you eggs oil in your pasta and even oil in your bacon containers. Believe it or not the bread as it may sound funny was nice and fresh daily and a nice addition to our meals. The last thing that I want to do is scare people from this resort I am not a picky eater but like most who travel have conserns on what I eat. As posted earlier book your specialty restaurants the first day you arrive or you will miss out. The other problem I have is a pay safe. I have stayed in a dozen all inclusive resorts and this is the first resort that I had to pay for the use of a safe $28us a week. Most resorts charge you for a lost safe key but never for the use of their safe.The pools were great nice and big with plenty of room to yourself to float at your own leisure. The chairs were usually no problem to get a couple as long as your not too late of a sleeper. Usually we would get up and get them around 8am and had no problems at all by 10:00am the were getting full but there were still some to be had.The beach was nice with plenty of chairs and plenty of trees to get some nice shade and even a nice nap. The water was beautiful and the beach was nice and clean.Everyone who writes here will have a different experience even if there were there on the same week. I had a great time with just food being my only real concern from rating this resort real good. Take what we write with a grain of salt and go enjoy yourself. We all need a holiday and we make that holiday special with the people we go with and the people we meet.
65-XX,MALE,A real disappointent We were extremely disappointed in this hotel. The staff was rather unfriendly uncaring and not at all helpful. When we arrived we were supposed to get parking for our car; however upon our arrival we were told that there wad no more spots available so we should park in the public garage over one block away. We were not told at the time of the reservation that parking was not always available. The rooftop pool was in disrepair as the wood was not in good condition and even more important the pool was the size of a very tiny private pool. We were shocked at how small the pool was. The sundeck did not have enough chairs nor towels. We have traveled extensively and throught that this hotel would be good based on the web pictures; however the pictures are real deceiving. We would never go back to this hotel and would not recommend it to anyone.
50-64,FEMALE,Hidden Jewel Convenient loc clean safe rooms very affordable. Very helpful staff great restaurant recommendations. The free parking fridge microwave were bonuses too. We would stay there again
25-34,FEMALE,Good pick for times sq area The Westin is in a good location if you need to be in Times Square which i dont advocate. The room was a typical Westin - generally clean average amenities nice bathrobes and towels. This Westin had particularly thin walls - and i surely heard loud and clear noises that I did not want to hear. Ipod alarm clock would have been nice but didnt work and I couldnt set the alarm. The front desk staff were very nice the folks at 0 were rude.In general just another stay in a new york hotel
25-34,FEMALE,So lucky to find London Bridge I chose London Bridge Hotel because of the great rates- 99 pounds a night and the great reviews on tripadvisor.com. The hotel proved to be excellent from check-in to check-out.I arrived in London on a 6am flight. I had alerted LBH that I would be arriving early and requested early check-in. Upon arrival the hotel staff let me in and checked me in quickly. This was most appreciated since I hadnt slept on the way over.Upon entering the room I noticed that it was small but comfortable with plenty of space to move around. The bed was huge covered with pillows a nice duvet and very cushy though it felt as though it had had some wear. The flat screen tv was nice as was the minibar. I also appreciated the in-room safe and closet space. I also had a dresser which came in handy during my stay.Another huge perk to the hotel was that it was very close to London Bridge Station. A two minute walk. I often returned to the hotel late at night and at times got a little disoriented using the different tube exits. Nevertheless the area was quiet and seemed safe so no worries about wandering a few extra minutes to get my bearings. Another great thing about the area was that LBS connects very easily with other tube lines. I could always be where I needed to be in only a few stops. This hotel was extremely central though quiet- just outside of the hustle and bustle.As this was a short trip packed with London walks and visits with friends I never seemed to make it to breakfast which was included with my rate. Still the hotel was a welcoming place each evening. Magazines and newspapers were always handy and a staff member always on hand. I never required much help from concierge or reception but the one time I had some questions I was struck by the Spanish receptionists willingness to help me even provide me more information than expected I never expect that level of service. In terms of any problems with my stay I noticed that my toilet handle didnt seem to want to flush. It worked well enough so that I did not have to bother maintenance. Still I received a letter from the hotel today in fact thanking me for my good feedback as well as a note that they would look into the toilet handle to make any necessary repairs. I always appreciate follow-up to concerns and compliments. Rarely do hotels make this contact but when they do it is forever appreciated. Just writing about the hotel makes me want to go back. I am sure I will not forget this hotel and should I have a chance to come back to London I will check LBH first.
